They consist of billions to trillions of [[Parameter#Artificial intelligence|parameters]] and operate as general-purpose sequence models, generating, summarizing, translating, and reasoning over text. LLMs represent a significant new technology in their ability to generalize across tasks with minimal task-specific supervision, enabling capabilities like [[Conversational agent|conversational agents]], [[Automatic programming|code generation]], [[Information retrieval|knowledge retrieval]], and [[Automated reasoning|automated reasoning]] that previously required bespoke systems.<ref name="scaling-laws">{{cite arXiv|last1=Kaplan |first1=Jared |last2=McCandlish |first2=Sam |last3=Henighan |first3=Tom |last4=Brown |first4=Tom B. |last5=Chess |first5=Benjamin |last6=Child |first6=Rewon |last7=Gray |first7=Scott |last8=Radford |first8=Alec |last9=Wu |first9=Jeffrey |last10=Amodei |first10=Dario |date=2020 |title=Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models  |class=cs.LG |eprint=2001.08361}}</ref>

LLMs evolved from earlier [[Statistical model|statistical]] and [[Recurrent neural network|recurrent neural network]] approaches to language modeling. The [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|transformer architecture]], introduced in 2017, replaced recurrence with [[Attention (machine learning)|self-attention]], allowing efficient [[Parallel computing|parallelization]], longer context handling, and scalable training on unprecedented data volumes.<ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Vaswani |first1=Ashish |last2=Shazeer |first2=Noam |last3=Parmar |first3=Niki |last4=Uszkoreit |first4=Jakob |last5=Jones |first5=Llion |last6=Gomez |first6=Aidan N |last7=Kaiser |first7=Łukasz |last8=Polosukhin |first8=Illia |date=2017 |title=Attention is All you Need  |class=cs.CL |eprint=1706.03762}}</ref> This innovation enabled models like [[GPT (language model)|GPT]], [[BERT (language model)|BERT]], and their successors, which demonstrated [[Emergence|emergent behaviors]] at scale, such as [[prompt engineering|few-shot learning]] and compositional reasoning.<ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Devlin |first1=Jacob |last2=Chang |first2=Ming-Wei |last3=Lee |first3=Kenton |last4=Toutanova |first4=Kristina |date=2018 |title=BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding  |class=cs.CL |eprint=1810.04805}}</ref>

Before the emergence of transformer-based models in 2017, some [[Language model|language models]] were considered large relative to the computational and data constraints of their time. In the early 1990s, [[IBM]]'s statistical models pioneered [[Bitext word alignment|word alignment]] techniques for machine translation, laying the groundwork for [[Construction grammar|corpus-based language modeling]]. In 2001, a smoothed [[Word n-gram language model|''n''-gram model]], such as those employing [[Kneser–Ney smoothing]], trained on 300 million words, achieved state-of-the-art [[perplexity]] on benchmark tests.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Computer Speech and Language|last=Goodman |first=Joshua |title=A Bit of Progress in Language Modeling |date=2001-08-09 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=403–434 |doi=10.1006/csla.2001.0174 |arxiv=cs/0108005 }}</ref> During the 2000s, with the rise of widespread internet access, researchers began compiling massive text datasets from the web ("web as corpus"<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kilgarriff |first1=Adam |last2=Grefenstette |first2=Gregory |date=September 2003 |title=Introduction to the Special Issue on the Web as Corpus |url=https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/29/3/333-347/1816 |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=333–347 |doi=10.1162/089120103322711569 |issn=0891-2017}}</ref>) to train statistical language models.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Banko |first1=Michele |last2=Brill |first2=Eric |date=2001 |title=Scaling to very very large corpora for natural language disambiguation |journal=Proceedings of the 39th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics - ACL '01 |pages=26–33 |location=Morristown, NJ, USA |publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics |doi=10.3115/1073012.1073017|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Resnik |first1=Philip |last2=Smith |first2=Noah A. |date=September 2003 |title=The Web as a Parallel Corpus |url=https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/29/3/349-380/1809 |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=349–380 |doi=10.1162/089120103322711578 |issn=0891-2017 |doi-access=free |access-date=2024-06-07 |archive-date=2024-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240607172811/https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/29/3/349-380/1809 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

This shift was marked by the development of [[Word embedding|word embeddings]] (eg, [[Word2vec|Word2Vec]] by Mikolov in 2013) and sequence-to-sequence ([[seq2seq]]) models using [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]]. In 2016, Google transitioned its translation service to [[neural machine translation]] (NMT), replacing statistical phrase-based models with deep [[Recurrent neural network|recurrent neural networks]]. These early NMT systems used LSTM-based [[Encoder-decoder model|encoder-decoder architectures]], as they preceded the invention of [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|transformers]]. [[File:The-Transformer-model-architecture.png|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of the main components of the transformer model from the original paper, where layers were normalized after (instead of before) multiheaded attention]]

Open-weight LLMs have increasingly shaped the field since 2023, contributing to broader participation in AI development and greater transparency in model evaluation. Vake et al. (2025) demonstrated that community-driven contributions to open-weight models measurably improve their efficiency and performance, with user participation growing rapidly on collaborative platforms such as Hugging Face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vake |first1=Domen |last2=Šinik |first2=Bogdan |last3=Vičič |first3=Jernej |last4=Tošić |first4=Aleksandar |title=Is Open Source the Future of AI?

== Dataset preprocessing ==
{{See also|List of datasets for machine-learning research#Internet}}

===Tokenization===
As [[machine learning]] algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an [[Word embedding|embedding]] is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include [[byte-pair encoding]] (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as [[Control character|control characters]], such as <code>[MASK]</code> for masked-out token (as used in [[BERT (language model)|BERT]]), and <code>[UNK]</code> ("unknown") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, "Ġ" denotes a preceding whitespace in [[RoBERTa]] and GPT and "##" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=NAACL |last1=Kaushal |first1=Ayush |title=What do tokens know about their characters and how do they know it? |date=2022-06-06 |url=https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.179.pdf |last2=Mahowald |first2=Kyle }}</ref>

For example, the BPE tokenizer used by the legacy version of [[GPT-3]] would split <small><code>tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical "tokens"</code></small> as
{| cellpadding="0;" cellspacing="0;" style="border:1px solid black"
|-
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |token 
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |izer 
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |:
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;texts
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;->
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |series 
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;of
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;numerical

| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |ens
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |" 
|}

Tokenization also [[Data compression|compress]]es the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an [[Array (data structure)|array]] that is not [[Jagged array|jagged]], the shorter texts must be "padded" until they match the length of the longest one. The average number of words per token depends on the language.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Yennie Jun |date=2023-05-03 |title=All languages are NOT created (tokenized) equal |url=https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230817165705/https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized |archive-date=2023-08-17 |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=Language models cost much more in some languages than others |quote=In other words, to express the same sentiment, some languages require up to 10 times more tokens.}}</ref><ref name="LangModelTokenizsersUnfairness">{{Cite journal |last1=Petrov |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Malfa |first2=Emanuele La |last3=Torr |first3=Philip |last4=Bibi |first4=Adel |date=June 23, 2023 |title=Language Model Tokenizers Introduce Unfairness Between Languages |url=https://openreview.net/forum?id=Pj4YYuxTq9 |url-status=live |journal=NeurIPS |arxiv=2305.15425 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231215212906/https://openreview.net/forum?id=Pj4YYuxTq9 |archive-date=December 15, 2023 |access-date=September 16, 2023 |via=openreview.net}}</ref> In English, the ratio is typically around 0.75 words per token, with 4 characters per token on average.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sutherland |first=Richard |date=2024-12-19 |title=Claude AI Pricing: How Much Does Anthropic's AI Cost? |url=https://tech.co/news/how-much-does-claude-ai-cost |access-date=2025-08-16 |website=Tech.co |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Byte-pair encoding ====
{{Main|Byte-pair encoding}}

As an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and [[punctuation mark]]s) are treated as an initial set of [[n-gram|''n''-grams]] (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) ''n''-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier ''n''-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained. After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.<ref name="2022Book_">{{cite book |last1=Paaß |first1=Gerhard |title=Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing |last2=Giesselbach |first2=Sven |date=2022 |isbn=978-3-031-23190-2 |series=Artificial Intelligence: Foundations, Theory, and Algorithms |pages=19–78 |chapter=Pre-trained Language Models |doi=10.1007/978-3-031-23190-2_2 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==== Problems ====
A token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the [[Shan language]] from [[Myanmar]]. Even more widespread languages such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[German language|German]] have "a premium of 50%" compared to English.<ref name="LangModelTokenizsersUnfairness"/>

===Dataset cleaning===
{{Main|Data cleansing}}

In the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data.<ref name="aYNg4">{{Cite journal |journal=EMNLP |first1=Jesse |last1=Dodge |first2=Maarten |last2=Sap |title=Documenting Large Webtext Corpora: A Case Study on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus |last3=Marasović |first3=Ana |last4=Agnew |first4=William |last5=Ilharco |first5=Gabriel |last6=Groeneveld |first6=Dirk |last7=Mitchell |first7=Margaret |last8=Gardner |first8=Matt |year=2021 |doi=10.1145/3571730 |arxiv=2104.08758 |url=https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.98.pdf}}</ref> Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Katherine |last2=Ippolito |first2=Daphne |last3=Nystrom |first3=Andrew |last4=Zhang |first4=Chiyuan |last5=Eck |first5=Douglas |last6=Callison-Burch |first6=Chris |last7=Carlini |first7=Nicholas |title=Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) |chapter=Deduplicating Training Data Makes Language Models Better |author7-link=Nicholas Carlini |date=May 2022 |chapter-url=https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.577.pdf |pages=8424–8445 |doi=10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.577}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Li |first1=Yuanzhi |title=Textbooks Are All You Need II: phi-1.5 technical report |date=2023-09-11 |eprint=2309.05463 |last2=Bubeck |first2=Sébastien |last3=Eldan |first3=Ronen |last4=Del Giorno |first4=Allie |last5=Gunasekar |first5=Suriya |last6=Lee |first6=Yin Tat |class=cs.CL }}</ref> A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=NeurIPS |first1=Zhenghao |last1=Lin |first2=Zhibin |last2=Gou |title=Rho-1: Not All Tokens Are What You Need |date=2024-04-11 |last3=Gong |first3=Yeyun |last4=Liu |first4=Xiao |last5=Shen |first5=Yelong |last6=Xu |first6=Ruochen |last7=Lin |first7=Chen |last8=Yang |first8=Yujiu |last9=Jiao |first9=Jian |volume=37 |pages=29029–29063 |isbn=979-8-3313-1438-5 |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3737916.3738830}}</ref>

With the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).<ref name="few-shot-learners2"/>

=== Synthetic data ===
{{Main|Synthetic data}}

Training of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's [[Phi (LLM)|Phi]] series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.<ref>{{cite arXiv |first1=Marah |last1=Abdin |first2=Sam Ade |last2=Jacobs |title=Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone |date=2024-04-23 |last3=Awan |first3=Ammar Ahmad |last4=Aneja |first4=Jyoti |last5=Awadallah |first5=Ahmed |last6=Awadalla |first6=Hany |last7=Bach |first7=Nguyen |last8=Bahree |first8=Amit |last9=Bakhtiari |first9=Arash |class=cs.CL |eprint=2404.14219 }}</ref>

== Training ==
{{See also|Fine-tuning (machine learning)}}

An LLM is a type of [[foundation model]] (large X model) trained on language. LLMs can be trained in different ways. In particular, GPT models are first pretrained to predict the next word on a large amount of data, before being fine-tuned.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wolfram |first=Stephen |title=What is ChatGPT doing ... and why does it work? |date=2023 |publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc |isbn=978-1-57955-081-3 |location=Champaign, Illinois}}</ref>

=== Cost ===
[[File:Estimated_training_cost_of_some_AI_models_-_2024_AI_index.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5]]
Substantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the [[list of large language models]]. For example, the training of GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the [[PaLM]] (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million. The qualifier "large" in "large language model" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as "large". [[GPT-1]] of 2018 has 117 million parameters.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

=== Fine-tuning ===
Before being [[Fine-tuning (deep learning)|fine-tuned]], most LLMs are next-token predictors. The fine-tuning shapes the LLM's behavior via techniques like [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF)<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last=Paul Christiano, Jan Leike, Tom B. Brown, Miljan Martic, Shane Legg, Dario Amodei |date=2017 |title=Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences |class=stat.ML |eprint=1706.03741 }}</ref> or [[constitutional AI]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=2023-05-09 |title=AI gains "values" with Anthropic's new Constitutional AI chatbot approach |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/ai-with-a-moral-compass-anthropic-outlines-constitutional-ai-in-its-claude-chatbot/ |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=Ars Technica |language=en}}</ref>

Instruction fine-tuning is a form of [[supervised learning]] used to teach LLMs to follow user instructions. In 2022, OpenAI demonstrated [[InstructGPT]], a version of GPT-3 similarly fine-tuned to follow instructions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Snyder |first=Alison |date=2022-01-27 |title=Next generation AI can follow a person's instructions and intentions |url=https://www.axios.com/2022/01/27/ai-instructions-learning-algorithm |access-date=2025-08-07 |website=Axios |language=en}}</ref> 

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model to predict which text humans prefer. Then, the LLM can be fine-tuned through [[reinforcement learning]] to better satisfy this reward model. Since humans typically prefer truthful, helpful and harmless answers, RLHF favors such answers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Appen |first=Sujatha Sagiraju |date=2023-04-23 |title=How reinforcement learning with human feedback is unlocking the power of generative AI |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-reinforcement-learning-with-human-feedback-is-unlocking-the-power-of-generative-ai/ |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20250725060432/https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-reinforcement-learning-with-human-feedback-is-unlocking-the-power-of-generative-ai/ |archive-date=2025-07-25 |access-date=2025-11-16 |work=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
LLMs are generally based on the [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|transformer]] architecture, which leverages an [[Attention (machine learning)|attention]] mechanism that enables the model to process relationships between all elements in a sequence simultaneously, regardless of their distance from each other.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

=== Attention mechanism and context window ===
{{See also|Attention (machine learning)}}
[[File:Multiple attention heads.png|upright=1.3|thumb | When each head calculates, according to its own criteria, how much other tokens are relevant for the "it_" token, note that the second attention head, represented by the second column, is focusing most on the first two rows, i.e. the tokens "The" and "animal", while the third column is focusing most on the bottom two rows, i.e. on "tired", which has been tokenized into two tokens.<ref name="Jay_Allamar">{{Cite web | last=Allamar | first=Jay | title=Illustrated transformer | url=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ | access-date=2023-07-29 | archive-date=2023-07-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725230033/http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ | url-status=live }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2025}}]]

In order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates "soft" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own "relevance" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) [[GPT-2]] model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens.<ref name="Jay_Allamar_GPT2">{{Cite web | last=Allamar | first=Jay | title=The Illustrated GPT-2 (Visualizing Transformer Language Models) |url=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/ |access-date=2023-08-01 }}</ref> In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads.

Models may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as next sentence prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus.<ref name="jm" /> During training, [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during [[Training, validation, and test data sets|testing]] and evaluation.

=== Mixture of experts ===
{{Main|Mixture of experts}}

A [[mixture of experts]] (MoE) is a [[machine learning]] architecture in which multiple specialized neural networks ("experts") work together, with a gating mechanism that routes each input to the most appropriate expert(s). Mixtures of experts can reduce inference costs, as only a fraction of the parameters are used for each input.

=== Parameter size ===
{{see also|1.58-bit large language model}}
Typically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision [[floating point numbers]] (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have more than 100 billion parameters, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mann |first=Tobias |title=How to run an LLM locally on your PC in less than 10 minutes |url=https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/17/ai_pc_local_llm/ |access-date=2024-05-17 |website=www.theregister.com}}</ref>

Quantization can be further classified as ''static quantization'' if the quantization parameters are determined beforehand (typically during a calibration phase), and ''dynamic quantization'' if the quantization is applied during inference. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all the parameters to a given number of bits: this is applicable to static as well as dynamic quantization, but loses much precision. Dynamic quantization allows for the use of a different quantization [[Codebook#Data_compression|codebook]] per layer, either a lookup table of values or a linear mapping (scaling factor and bias), at the cost of foregoing the possible speed improvements from using lower-precision arithmetic.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

Quantized models are typically seen as frozen with modification of weights (e.g. fine-tuning) only applied to the original model. It is possible to fine-tune quantized models using [[LoRA|low-rank adaptation]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mittal |first=Aayush Mittal |date=2023-10-24 |title=LoRa, QLoRA and QA-LoRA: Efficient Adaptability in Large Language Models Through Low-Rank Matrix Factorization |url=https://www.unite.ai/lora-qlora-and-qa-lora-efficient-adaptability-in-large-language-models-through-low-rank-matrix-factorization/ |access-date=2025-11-16 |website=Unite.AI |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Extensibility ==
Beyond basic text generation, various techniques have been developed to extend LLM capabilities, including the use of external tools and data sources, improved reasoning on complex problems, and enhanced instruction-following or autonomy through prompting methods.

=== Prompt engineering ===
{{Main|Prompt engineering}}

In 2020, [[OpenAI]] researchers demonstrated that their new model [[GPT-3]] could understand what format to use given a few rounds of Q and A (or other type of task) in the input data as example, thanks in part due to the RLHF technique. This technique, called ''few-shot prompting'', allows LLMs to be adapted to any task without requiring fine-tuning.<ref name="few-shot-learners2"/> Also in 2022, it was found that the base GPT-3 model can generate an instruction based on user input. The generated instruction along with user input is then used as input to another instance of the model under a "Instruction: [...], Input: [...], Output:" format. The other instance is able to complete the output and often produces the correct answer in doing so. The ability to "self-instruct" makes LLMs able to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] themselves toward a correct answer.<ref name="self-instruct-paper">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.754/ |first1=Yizhong |last1=Wang |first2=Yeganeh |last2=Kordi |title=Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Model with Self Generated Instructions |date=2023 |last3=Mishra |first3=Swaroop |last4=Liu |first4=Alisa |last5=Smith |first5=Noah A. |last6=Khashabi |first6=Daniel |last7=Hajishirzi |first7=Hannaneh |chapter=Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions |pages=13484–13508 |doi=10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.754 }}</ref>

=== Dialogue processing (chatbot) ===
An LLM can be turned into a chatbot by specializing it for conversation. User input is prefixed with a marker such as "Q:" or "User:" and the LLM is asked to predict the output after a fixed "A:" or "Assistant:". This type of model became commercially available in 2022 with ChatGPT, a sibling model of InstructGPT fine-tuned to accept and produce dialog-formatted text based on GPT-3.5. It could similarly follow user instructions. Before the stream of User and Assistant lines, a chat context usually start with a few lines of overarching instructions, from a role called "developer" or "system" to convey a higher authority than the user's input. This is called a "system prompt".{{cn|date=November 2025}}

=== Retrieval-augmented generation ===
[[Retrieval-augmented generation]] (RAG) is an approach that integrates LLMs with [[document retrieval]] systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a [[vector database]]) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.<ref name="BUZBP">{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Patrick |last2=Perez |first2=Ethan |last3=Piktus |first3=Aleksandra |last4=Petroni |first4=Fabio |last5=Karpukhin |first5=Vladimir |last6=Goyal |first6=Naman |last7=Küttler |first7=Heinrich |last8=Lewis |first8=Mike |last9=Yih |first9=Wen-tau |last10=Rocktäschel |first10=Tim |last11=Riedel |first11=Sebastian |last12=Kiela |first12=Douwe |date=2020 |title=Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Abstract.html |journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |publisher=Curran Associates, Inc. |volume=33 |pages=9459–9474 |arxiv=2005.11401 |access-date=2023-06-12 |archive-date=2023-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230612171229/https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Abstract.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Tool use ===
Tool use is a mechanism that enables LLMs to interact with external systems, applications, or data sources. It can allow for example to fetch real-time information from an API or to execute code. A program separate from the LLM watches the output stream of the LLM for a special tool-calling syntax. When these special tokens appear, the program calls the tool accordingly and feeds its output back into the LLM's input stream.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dickson |first=Ben |date=2025-04-02 |title=The tool integration problem that's holding back enterprise AI (and how CoTools solves it) |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-tool-integration-problem-thats-holding-back-enterprise-ai-and-how-cotools-solves-it/ |access-date=2025-05-26 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

Early tool-using LLMs were fine-tuned on the use of specific tools. But fine-tuning LLMs for the ability to read [[API]] documentation and call API correctly has greatly expanded the range of tools accessible to an LLM.<ref name="lLrda">{{Cite journal |journal=Science |first1=Yaobo |last1=Liang |first2=Chenfei |last2=Wu |title=TaskMatrix.AI: Completing Tasks by Connecting Foundation Models with Millions of APIs |date=2024 |last3=Song |first3=Ting |last4=Wu |first4=Wenshan |last5=Xia |first5=Yan |last6=Liu |first6=Yu |last7=Ou |first7=Yang |last8=Lu |first8=Shuai |last9=Ji |first9=Lei |last10=Mao |first10=Shaoguang |last11=Wang |first11=Yun |last12=Shou |first12=Linjun |last13=Gong |first13=Ming |last14=Duan |first14=Nan |volume=3 |article-number=0063 |doi=10.34133/icomputing.0063 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="4Xzrs">{{Cite journal |last1=Patil |first1=Shishir G. |last2=Zhang |first2=Tianjun |last3=Wang |first3=Xin |last4=Gonzalez |first4=Joseph E. |date=2023-05-01 |title=Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs |journal=NeurIPS |volume=37 |pages=126544–126565 |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/e4c61f578ff07830f5c37378dd3ecb0d-Abstract-Conference.html}}</ref> Describing available tools in the system prompt can also make an LLM able to use tools.

=== Agency ===
{{Main article|AI agent}}

An LLM is typically not an [[autonomous agent]] by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions. But it can be transformed into an agent by adding supporting elements: the role (profile) and the surrounding environment of an agent can be additional inputs to the LLM, while memory can be integrated as a tool or provided as additional input. Instructions and input patterns are used to make the LLM plan actions and tool use is used to potentially carry out these actions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Lei |last2=Ma |first2=Chen |last3=Feng |first3=Xueyang |last4=Zhang |first4=Zeyu |last5=Yang |first5=Hao |last6=Zhang |first6=Jingsen |last7=Chen |first7=Zhiyuan |last8=Tang |first8=Jiakai |last9=Chen |first9=Xu |last10=Lin |first10=Yankai |last11=Zhao |first11=Wayne Xin |last12=Wei |first12=Zhewei |last13=Wen |first13=Jirong |title=A survey on large language model based autonomous agents |journal=Frontiers of Computer Science |date=December 2024 |volume=18 |issue=6 |article-number=186345 |doi=10.1007/s11704-024-40231-1|arxiv=2308.11432}}</ref>

The ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of ''reason'' and ''act'', constructs an [[Intelligent agent|agent]] out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to "think out loud". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment.<ref name="DmvNE">{{Cite arXiv  |first1=Shunyu |last1=Yao |first2=Jeffrey |last2=Zhao |title=ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models |date=2022-10-01 |last3=Yu |first3=Dian |last4=Du |first4=Nan |last5=Shafran |first5=Izhak |last6=Narasimhan |first6=Karthik |last7=Cao |first7=Yuan |class=cs.CL |eprint=2210.03629 }}</ref>

In the DEPS ("describe, explain, plan and select") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions. It is then prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and the environmental feedback it receives.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=NeurIPS |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3666122.3667602 |first1=Zihao |last1=Wang |first2=Shaofei |last2=Cai |title=Describe, Explain, Plan and Select: Interactive Planning with Large Language Models Enables Open-World Multi-Task Agents |date=2023-02-03 |last3=Liu |first3=Anji |last4=Ma |first4=Xiaojian |last5=Liang |first5=Yitao |pages=34153–34189 }}</ref>

The ''Reflexion method'' constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up "lessons learned", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These "lessons learned" are stored as a form of long-term memory and given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.<ref name="sbB2T">{{Cite journal |journal=NeurIPS |last1=Shinn |first1=Noah |last2=Cassano |first2=Federico |last3=Labash |first3=Beck |last4=Gopinath |first4=Ashwin |last5=Narasimhan |first5=Karthik |last6=Yao |first6=Shunyu |date=2023-03-01 |title=Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning |pages=34153–34189 |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3666122.3667602}}</ref>

[[Monte Carlo tree search]] can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.<ref name="ltTer">{{Cite journal |journal=EMNLP |url=https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.507/ |first1=Shibo |last1=Hao |first2=Yi |last2=Gu |title=Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model |date=2023-05-01 |last3=Ma |first3=Haodi |last4=Jiahua Hong |first4=Joshua |last5=Wang |first5=Zhen |last6=Zhe Wang |first6=Daisy |last7=Hu |first7=Zhiting |pages=8154–8173 |doi=10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.507 }}</ref>

=== Reasoning ===

LLMs are conventionally trained to generate an output without generating intermediate steps. As a result, their performance tends to be subpar on complex questions requiring (at least in humans) intermediate steps of thought. Early research demonstrated that inserting intermediate "scratchpad" computations could improve performance on such tasks.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Nye |first1=Maxwell |last2=Anders |first2=Andreassen Johan |last3=Gur-Ari |first3=Guy |last4=Michalewski |first4=Henryk |last5=Austin |first5=Jacob |last6=Bieber |first6=David |last7=Dohan |first7=David |last8=Lewkowycz |first8=Aitor |last9=Bosma |first9=Maarten |last10=Luan |first10=David |last11=Sutton |first11=Charles |last12=Odena |first12=Augustus |date=30 November 2021 |title=Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language Models |class=cs.LG |eprint=2112.00114}}</ref> Later methods overcame this deficiency more systematically by breaking tasks into smaller steps for the LLM, either manually or automatically.

==== Chaining ====
''Prompt chaining'' was introduced in 2022.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Tongshuang |last2=Jiang |first2=Ellen |last3=Donsbach |first3=Aaron |last4=Gray |first4=Jeff |last5=Molina |first5=Alejandra |last6=Terry |first6=Michael |last7=Cai |first7=Carrie J |display-authors=1 |chapter=PromptChainer: Chaining Large Language Model Prompts through Visual Programming |date=2022-04-28 |title=CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Extended Abstracts |chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1145/3491101.3519729 |series= |location= |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages= 1–10|doi=10.1145/3491101.3519729 |isbn=978-1-4503-9156-6}}</ref> In this method, a user manually breaks a complex problem down into several steps. In each step, the LLM receives as input a prompt telling it what to do and some results from preceding steps. The result from one step is then reused in a next step, until a final answer is reached. The ability of an LLM to follow instructions means that even non-experts can write a successful collection of stepwise prompts given a few rounds of trial and error.<ref>{{cite conference |conference=CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems| last1 = Wu| first1 = Tongshuang| last2 = Jiang| first2 = Ellen| last3 = Donsbach| first3 = Aaron| last4 = Gray| first4 = Jeff| last5 = Molina| first5 = Alejandra| last6 = Terry| first6 = Michael| last7 = Cai| first7 = Carrie J.| title = PromptChainer: Chaining Large Language Model Prompts through Visual Programming| date = 2022-03-13| doi = 10.1145/3491101.3519729| url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3519729| arxiv = 2203.06566}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=23 April 2024 |title=What is prompt chaining? |url=https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-chaining |website=IBM |language=en}}</ref>

A 2022 paper demonstrated a separate technique called ''[[chain-of-thought prompting]]'', which makes the LLM break the question down autonomously. An LLM is given some examples where the "assistant" verbally breaks down the thought process before arriving at an answer. The LLM mimics these examples and also tries to spend some time generating intermediate steps before providing the final answer. This additional step elicited by prompting improves the correctness of the LLM on relatively complex questions. On math word questions, a prompted model can exceed even fine-tuned GPT-3 with a verifier.<ref name="auto2">{{cite journal |last1=Wei |first1=Jason |last2=Wang |first2=Xuezhi |last3=Schuurmans |first3=Dale |last4=Bosma |first4=Maarten |last5=Ichter |first5=Brian |last6=Xia |first6=Fei |last7=Chi |first7=Ed |last8=Le |first8=Quoc |last9=Zhou |first9=Denny |date=2023-01-10 |title=Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3600270.3602070 |journal=NeurIPS |pages=24824–24837 |isbn=978-1-7138-7108-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=23 April 2025 |title=What is chain of thought (CoT) prompting? |url=https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts |website=IBM |language=en}}</ref> Chain-of-thought can also be elicited by simply adding an instruction like "Let's think step by step" to the prompt, in order to encourage the LLM to proceed methodically instead of trying to directly guess the answer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schreiner |first=Maximilian |date=2022-09-27 |title=Deeper insights into AI language models - chain of thought prompting as a success factor |url=https://the-decoder.com/deeper-insights-for-ai-language-models-chain-of-thought-prompting-as-a-key-factor/ |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=The Decoder |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Model-native reasoning ====
{{Main article|Reasoning model|Reflection (artificial intelligence)}}

In late 2024, a new approach to LLM development emerged with "reasoning models".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wiggers |first=Kyle |date=2024-12-14 |title='Reasoning' AI models have become a trend, for better or worse |url=https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/14/reasoning-ai-models-have-become-a-trend-for-better-or-worse/ |access-date=2025-11-16 |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US}}</ref> These are trained to generate step-by-step analysis before producing final answers, enabling better results on complex tasks, for instance in mathematics, coding and logic.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-05-08 |title=AI Developers Look Beyond Chain-of-Thought Prompting |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/chain-of-thought-prompting |access-date=2025-11-16 |website=IEEE Spectrum |language=en}}</ref> OpenAI introduced this concept with their [[OpenAI o1|o1]] model in September 2024, followed by [[OpenAI o3|o3]] in April 2025. On the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|International Mathematics Olympiad]] qualifying exam problems, [[GPT-4o]] achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.<ref name="nyt-o3">{{cite news |last=Metz |first=Cade |title=OpenAI Unveils New A.I.

In January 2025, the Chinese company [[DeepSeek]] released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.<ref name="nature-deepseek">{{cite news |last=Gibney |first=Elizabeth |title=China's cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00229-6 |work=Nature |date=2025-01-30 |access-date=2025-02-03}}</ref>

These reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step.<ref name="nyt-o3" />

=== Inference optimization ===
Inference optimization refers to techniques that improve LLM performance by applying additional computational resources during the inference process, rather than requiring model retraining. These approaches implement various state-of-the-art reasoning and decision-making strategies to enhance accuracy and capabilities.

'''OptiLLM''' is an [[OpenAI]] API-compatible optimizing inference proxy that implements multiple inference optimization techniques simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Sharma, Asankhaya |title=OptiLLM: Optimizing inference proxy for LLMs |url=https://github.com/codelion/optillm |website=GitHub |access-date=2025-08-05}}</ref> The system acts as a transparent proxy that can work with any LLM provider, implementing techniques such as [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS), [[Mixture of experts|mixture of agents]] (MOA), best-of-N sampling, and chain-of-thought reflection. OptiLLM demonstrates that strategic application of computational resources at inference time can substantially improve model performance across diverse tasks, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks such as the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination|AIME]] 2024 mathematics competition and various coding challenges.<ref>{{Cite web |title=OptiLLM: An OpenAI API Compatible Optimizing Inference Proxy which Implements Several State-of-the-Art Techniques that can Improve the Accuracy and Performance of LLMs |url=https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/11/18/optillm-an-openai-api-compatible-optimizing-inference-proxy-which-implements-several-state-of-the-art-techniques-that-can-improve-the-accuracy-and-performance-of-llms/ |website=MarkTechPost |date=2024-11-18 |access-date=2025-08-05}}</ref>

These inference optimization approaches represent a growing category of tools that enhance existing LLMs without requiring access to model weights or retraining, making advanced reasoning capabilities more accessible across different model providers and use cases.

A common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to "tokenize" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder <math>E</math>. Make a small [[multilayer perceptron]] <math>f</math>, so that for any image <math>y</math>, the post-processed vector <math>f(E(y))</math> has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an "image token". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be [[Hang (computing)|frozen]] to improve stability.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=ICML |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3618408.3619222 |last1=Li |first1=Junnan |last2=Li |first2=Dongxu |last3=Savarese |first3=Silvio |last4=Hoi |first4=Steven |date=2023-01-01 |title=BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models |volume=202 |pages=19730–19742 }}</ref> This type of method, where embeddings from multiple modalities are fused and the predictor is trained on the combined embeddings, is called ''early fusion''.

Another method, called ''intermediate fusion'', involves each modality being first processed independently to obtain modality-specific representations; then these intermediate representations are fused together.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Puneet |last2=Khokher |first2=Vedanti |last3=Gupta |first3=Yukti |last4=Raman |first4=Balasubramanian |title=Hybrid Fusion Based Approach for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Insufficient Labeled Data |date=2021 |pages=314–318 |doi=10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506714 |isbn=978-1-6654-4115-5 }}</ref> In general, cross-attention is used for integrating information from different modalities.

=== Non-natural languages ===
LLMs can handle [[Programming language|programming languages]] similarly to how they handle natural languages. No special change in token handling is needed as code, like human language, is represented as plain text. LLMs can generate code based on problems or instructions written in [[natural language]]. They can also describe code in natural language or translate it into other programming languages. They were originally used as a [[code completion]] tool, but advances have moved them towards [[automatic programming]]. Services such as [[GitHub Copilot]] offer LLMs specifically trained, fine-tuned, or prompted for programming.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Finnie-Ansley |first1=James |last2=Denny |first2=Paul |last3=Becker |first3=Brett A. |last4=Luxton-Reilly |first4=Andrew |last5=Prather |first5=James |title=Proceedings of the 24th Australasian Computing Education Conference |chapter=The Robots Are Coming: Exploring the Implications of OpenAI Codex on Introductory Programming |date=14 February 2022 |language=en-US |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages=10–19 |doi=10.1145/3511861.3511863 |isbn=978-1-4503-9643-1 |s2cid=246681316 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Husein |first1=Rasha Ahmad |last2=Aburajouh |first2=Hala |last3=Catal |first3=Cagatay |title=Large language models for code completion: A systematic literature review |journal=Computer Standards & Interfaces |date=March 2025 |volume=92 |article-number=103917 |doi=10.1016/j.csi.2024.103917}}</ref>

In [[computational biology]], transformer-base architectures, such as [[DNA large language model|DNA LLMs]], have also proven useful in analyzing biological sequences: [[protein]], [[DNA]], and [[RNA]]. With proteins they appear able to capture a degree of "grammar" from the amino-acid sequence, by mapping that sequence into an [[embedding (machine learning)|embedding]].

=== Scaling laws ===
{{Main|Neural scaling law}}

The performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:
* <small><math>C</math></small>: cost of pretraining (the total amount of compute used),
* <small><math>N</math></small>: size of the [[artificial neural network]] itself, such as number of parameters (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),
* <small><math>D</math></small>: size of its pretraining dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus).

''Scaling laws'' are [[empirical statistical laws]] that predict LLM performance based on such factors. One particular scaling law ("[[Chinchilla AI|Chinchilla scaling]]") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a [[Log-log plot|log-log]] [[learning rate]] schedule, states that:<ref name="fJta3">{{Cite journal |journal=NeurIPS |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3600270.3602446 |first1=Jordan |last1=Hoffmann |first2=Sebastian |last2=Borgeaud |title=Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models |date=2022-03-29 |last3=Mensch |first3=Arthur |last4=Buchatskaya |first4=Elena |last5=Cai |first5=Trevor |last6=Rutherford |first6=Eliza |last7=Casas |first7=Diego de Las |last8=Hendricks |first8=Lisa Anne |last9=Welbl |first9=Johannes |last10=Clark |first10=Aidan |last11=Hennigan |first11=Tom |last12=Noland |first12=Eric |last13=Millican |first13=Katie |last14=Driessche |first14=George van den |last15=Damoc |first15=Bogdan |pages=30016–30030 |isbn=978-1-7138-7108-8 }}</ref>

Schaeffer ''et al.'' argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a [[Neural scaling law|smooth scaling law]].

== Interpretation ==
=== Mechanistic interpretability ===
[[Mechanistic interpretability]] seeks to precisely identify and understand how individual neurons or circuits within LLMs produce specific behaviors or outputs. By reverse-engineering model components at a granular level, researchers aim to detect and mitigate safety concerns such as emergent harmful behaviors, biases, deception, or unintended goal pursuit before deployment. Mechanistic interpretability research has been conducted at organizations like Anthropic and OpenAI, although understanding the inner workings of LLMs remains difficult.{{cn|date=November 2025}}

The reverse-engineering may lead to the discovery of algorithms that approximate inferences performed by an LLM. For instance, the authors trained small transformers on [[Modular arithmetic|modular arithmetic addition]]. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used [[discrete Fourier transform]].<ref name="oYGlo">{{Cite arXiv  |first1=Neel |last1=Nanda |first2=Lawrence |last2=Chan |title=Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability |date=2023-01-01 |last3=Lieberum |first3=Tom |last4=Smith |first4=Jess |last5=Steinhardt |first5=Jacob |class=cs.LG |eprint=2301.05217 }}</ref> The training of the model also highlighted a phenomenon called [[Grokking (machine learning)|grokking]], in which the model initially memorizes the training set ([[overfitting]]), and later suddenly learns to actually perform the calculation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ananthaswamy |first=Anil |date=2024-04-12 |title=How Do Machines 'Grok' Data? |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-do-machines-grok-data-20240412/ |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=[[Quanta Magazine]] |language=en}}</ref>

The matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects – the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human-like language.<ref name="debate understanding" /> These aspects of language as a model of [[cognition]] have been developed in the field of [[cognitive linguistics]]. American linguist [[George Lakoff]] presented ''neural theory of language'' (NTL)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Philosophy; Appendix: The Neural Theory of Language Paradigm |last= Lakoff |first= George |publisher= New York Basic Books|year=1999|isbn=978-0-465-05674-3|pages=569–583}}</ref> as a [[Cognitive linguistics#Computational approaches|computational basis]] for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding.

After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled ''[[The Language Myth|The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct]]'', British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist [[Vyvyan Evans]] mapped out the role of [[probabilistic context-free grammar]] (PCFG) in enabling [[Natural language processing#Cognition|NLP to model cognitive patterns]] and generate human-like language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Language Myth |last= Evans |first= Vyvyan. |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-04396-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior; Chapter 4 The Generative Models of Active Inference |last= Friston |first= Karl J. |publisher= The MIT Press|year=2022|isbn=978-0-262-36997-8}}</ref>

=== Perplexity ===
The canonical measure of the performance of any language model is its [[perplexity]] on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.

<math display="block">\log(\text{Perplexity}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log(\Pr(\text{token}_i \mid \text{context for token}_i))</math>

Here, <math>N</math> is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and "context for token <math>i</math>" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then "context for token <math>i</math>" is the segment of text appearing before token <math>i</math>. If the LLM is masked, then "context for token <math>i</math>" is the segment of text surrounding token <math>i</math>.

Because language models may [[overfit]] to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a [[test set]].<ref name="jm" /> This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.<ref name="few-shot-learners3">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Tom B. |last2=Mann |first2=Benjamin |last3=Ryder |first3=Nick |last4=Subbiah |first4=Melanie |last5=Kaplan |first5=Jared |last6=Dhariwal |first6=Prafulla |last7=Neelakantan |first7=Arvind |last8=Shyam |first8=Pranav |last9=Sastry |first9=Girish |last10=Askell |first10=Amanda |last11=Agarwal |first11=Sandhini |last12=Herbert-Voss |first12=Ariel |last13=Krueger |first13=Gretchen |last14=Henighan |first14=Tom |last15=Child |first15=Rewon |date=Dec 2020 |editor1-last=Larochelle |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=Ranzato |editor2-first=M. |editor3-last=Hadsell |editor3-first=R. |editor4-last=Balcan |editor4-first=M.F. |editor5-last=Lin |editor5-first=H. |title=Language Models are Few-Shot Learners |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |publisher=Curran Associates, Inc. |volume=33 |pages=1877–1901 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231117204007/https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf |archive-date=2023-11-17 |access-date=2023-03-14 |last25=Chess |last20=Hesse |first20=Christopher |last21=Chen |first21=Mark |last22=Sigler |first22=Eric |last23=Litwin |first23=Mateusz |last24=Gray |first24=Scott |first26=Jack |first25=Benjamin |last26=Clark |last19=Winter |last27=Berner |first27=Christopher |last28=McCandlish |first28=Sam |last29=Radford |first29=Alec |last30=Sutskever |first30=Ilya |last31=Amodei |first31=Dario |first19=Clemens |first18=Jeffrey |last18=Wu |last16=Ramesh |first16=Aditya |last17=Ziegler |first17=Daniel M.}}</ref>

====Measures====
In [[information theory]], the concept of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by [[Claude Shannon]].<ref name="Huyen">{{cite web |url=https://thegradient.pub/understanding-evaluation-metrics-for-language-models/ |title=Evaluation Metrics for Language Modeling |last=Huyen |first=Chip |date=October 18, 2019 |website=The Gradient |access-date=January 14, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Shannon |first=Claude E. |date=1948 |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=379–423 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x |bibcode=1948BSTJ...27..379S |url-access=subscription }}</ref> This relationship is mathematically expressed as <math>\text{Entropy} = \log_2(\text{Perplexity})</math>.

Entropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.

Notably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different LLMs, BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.

In the evaluation and comparison of language models, [[cross-entropy]] is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.

Due to their ability to accurately predict the next token, LLMs are highly capable in [[lossless compression]]. A 2023 study by DeepMind showed that the model [[Chinchilla (language model)|Chinchilla]], despite being trained primarily on text, was able to compress [[ImageNet]] to 43% of its size, beating PNG with 58%.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=2023-09-28 |title=AI language models can exceed PNG and FLAC in lossless compression, says study |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-language-models-can-exceed-png-and-flac-in-lossless-compression-says-study/ |access-date=2025-05-29 |website=Ars Technica |language=en}}</ref>

=== Benchmarks ===
[[Language model benchmark|Benchmarks]] are used to evaluate LLM performance on specific tasks. Tests evaluate capabilities such as general knowledge, bias, [[commonsense reasoning]], question answering, and mathematical problem-solving. Composite benchmarks examine multiple capabilities. Results are often sensitive to the prompting method.<ref>{{cite web|title=openai/simple-evals |date=2024-05-28 |url=https://github.com/openai/simple-evals |access-date=2024-05-28 |publisher=OpenAI}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=openai/evals |date=2024-05-28 |url=https://github.com/openai/evals |access-date=2024-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508225708/https://github.com/openai/evals |archive-date=2024-05-08 |url-status=live |publisher=OpenAI}}</ref>

A question-answering benchmark is termed "open book" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be combined with text that includes the sentence "The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016."<ref name="boolq" />). Otherwise, the task is considered "closed book", and the model must draw solely on its training.<ref name="survey">{{cite arXiv |eprint=2303.18223 |class=cs.CL |author1=Wayne Xin Zhao |first2=Kun |last2=Zhou |title=A Survey of Large Language Models |last3=Li |first3=Junyi |last4=Tang |first4=Tianyi |last5=Wang |first5=Xiaolei |last6=Hou |first6=Yupeng |last7=Min |first7=Yingqian |last8=Zhang |first8=Beichen |last9=Zhang |first9=Junjie |last10=Dong |first10=Zican |last11=Du |first11=Yifan |last12=Yang |first12=Chen |last13=Chen |first13=Yushuo |last14=Chen |first14=Zhipeng |last15=Jiang |first15=Jinhao |last16=Ren |first16=Ruiyang |last17=Li |first17=Yifan |last18=Tang |first18=Xinyu |last19=Liu |first19=Zikang |last20=Liu |first20=Peiyu |last21=Nie |first21=Jian-Yun |last22=Wen |first22=Ji-Rong |year=2023 |display-authors=1}}</ref> Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, [[MMLU]], BIG-bench, HELM, and [[HLE (Humanity's Last Exam)]].<ref name="Huyen" /><ref name="survey" />

An earlier standard tested using a portion of the evaluation dataset. It became more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques. Researchers vary in how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to the number of correct examples attached to the prompt (i.e. the value of ''n'' in ''n''-shot prompting).

In addition to standard NLP benchmarks, LLMs have been evaluated as substitutes for human annotators.

LLMs' rapid improvement regularly renders benchmarks obsolete, with the models exceeding the performance of human annotators.<ref name="bigbench">{{cite journal |journal=TMLR |first1=Aarohi |last1=Srivastava |first2=Abhinav |last2=Rastogi |title=Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models |last3=Rao |first3=Abhishek |author4=Abu Awal Md Shoeb |last5=Abid |first5=Abubakar |last6=Fisch |first6=Adam |last7=Brown |first7=Adam R. |last8=Santoro |first8=Adam |last9=Gupta |first9=Aditya |last10=Garriga-Alonso |first10=Adrià |last11=Kluska |first11=Agnieszka |last12=Lewkowycz |first12=Aitor |last13=Agarwal |first13=Akshat |last14=Power |first14=Alethea |last15=Ray |first15=Alex |last16=Warstadt |first16=Alex |last17=Kocurek |first17=Alexander W. |last18=Safaya |first18=Ali |last19=Tazarv |first19=Ali |last20=Xiang |first20=Alice |last21=Parrish |first21=Alicia |last22=Nie |first22=Allen |last23=Hussain |first23=Aman |last24=Askell |first24=Amanda |last25=Dsouza |first25=Amanda |last26=Slone |first26=Ambrose |last27=Rahane |first27=Ameet |last28=Iyer |first28=Anantharaman S. |last29=Andreassen |first29=Anders |last30=Madotto |first30=Andrea |year=2022 |display-authors=1 |arxiv=2206.04615 }}</ref> In addition, "shortcut learning" allows AIs to "cheat" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording to guess the correct responses, without considering the specific question.<ref name="debate understanding" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Niven |first1=Timothy |last2=Kao |first2=Hung-Yu |date=2019 |title=Probing Neural Network Comprehension of Natural Language Arguments |url=https://aclanthology.org/P19-1459/ |journal=ACL |pages=4658–4664 |doi=10.18653/v1/P19-1459 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Some datasets are adversarial, focusing on problems that confound LLMs. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions that stump LLMs by mimicking falsehoods to which they were exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer "No" to the question "Can you teach an old dog new tricks?" because of its exposure to the English idiom ''[[wikt:you can't teach an old dog new tricks|you can't teach an old dog new tricks]]'', even though this is not literally true.<ref name="truthfulqa">{{cite journal |journal=ACL |first1=Stephanie |last1=Lin |first2=Jacob |last2=Hilton |title=TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods |last3=Evans |first3=Owain |year=2021 |arxiv=2109.07958 }}</ref>

Another example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but defeated LLMs. Sample questions:
<blockquote>
We see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...

# demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.
# moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.
# then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.
# performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.<ref name="hellaswag">{{cite journal |journal=ACL |first1=Rowan |last1=Zellers |first2=Ari |last2=Holtzman |title=HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence? |last3=Bisk |first3=Yonatan |last4=Farhadi |first4=Ali |last5=Choi |first5=Yejin |year=2019 |arxiv=1905.07830 }}</ref>
</blockquote>
[[BERT (language model)|BERT]] selects 2 as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is 4.<ref name="hellaswag" />

== Limitations and challenges ==
Despite sophisticated architectures and massive scale, large language models exhibit persistent and well-documented limitations that constrain their deployment in high-stakes applications. 

=== Hallucinations ===
[[Hallucination (artificial intelligence)|Hallucinations]] represent a fundamental challenge, wherein models generate syntactically fluent text that appears factually sound, but is internally inconsistent with training data or factually incorrect. These hallucinations arise partly through memorization of training data combined with extrapolation beyond factual boundaries,{{Citation needed|date=October 2025}} with evaluations demonstrating that models can output verbatim passages from training data, when subjected to specific prompting sequences.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2021 |title=Extracting Training Data from Large Language Models |url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-carlini-extracting.pdf |journal=USENIX Security}}</ref>

=== Algorithmic bias ===
{{Main article|Algorithmic bias}}

While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Weijie |last2=Wang |first2=Yiwen |last3=Xue |first3=Chi |last4=Hu |first4=Xiangkun |last5=Fang |first5=Xi |last6=Dong |first6=Guimin |last7=Reddy |first7=Chandan K. |date=2025-06-28 |title=Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical Perspective |journal=COLM |arxiv=2506.19028}}</ref>

Gender bias manifests through stereotypical occupational associations, wherein models disproportionately assign [[nursing]] roles to women and [[engineering]] roles to men, reflecting systematic imbalances in training data demographics.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2016 |title=Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf |journal=NeurIPS}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=Predates large language models (published in 2016)|date=October 2025}} Language-based bias emerges from overrepresentation of English text in training corpora, which systematically downplays non-English perspectives and imposes English-centric worldviews through default response patterns.<ref name=":1" />

Due to the dominance of English-language content in LLM training data, models tend to favor English-language perspectives over those from minority languages. This bias is particularly evident when responding to English queries, where models may present Western interpretations of concepts from other cultures, such as Eastern religious practices.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-22 |title=A Perspectival Mirror of the Elephant |url=https://cacm.acm.org/practice/a-perspectival-mirror-of-the-elephant/ |website=Communications of the ACM |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Stereotyping ====
AI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes due to generalization, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. When replacing human representatives, this can lead to outputs that homogenize, or generalize groups of people.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Angelina |last2=Morgenstern |first2=Jamie |author2-link=Jamie Morgenstern |last3=Dickerson |first3=John P. |date=17 February 2025 |title=Large language models that replace human participants can harmfully misportray and flatten identity groups |journal=Nature Machine Intelligence |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=400–411 |arxiv=2402.01908 |doi=10.1038/s42256-025-00986-z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cheng |first1=Myra |last2=Durmus |first2=Esin |last3=Jurafsky |first3=Dan |date=2023-05-29 |title=Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models |journal=ACM |arxiv=2305.18189}}</ref>

In 2023, LLMs assigned roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms.<ref name=":8" /> For example, models might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men due to the frequency of these associations in documented reality.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kotek |first1=Hadas |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3582269.3615599 |title=Proceedings of the ACM Collective Intelligence Conference |last2=Dockum |first2=Rikker |last3=Sun |first3=David |date=2023-11-05 |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |isbn=979-8-4007-0113-9 |location=New York, NY, USA |pages=12–24 |chapter=Gender bias and stereotypes in Large Language Models |doi=10.1145/3582269.3615599 |arxiv=2308.14921}}</ref> In 2025, further research showed labs train to balance bias, but that testing for this places the model in a testmode, changing the natural distribution of model bias to prompts that do not include gender-specific keywords.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint=2509.04373 |class=cs.CL |first1=Bufan |last1=Gao |first2=Elisa |last2=Kreiss |title=Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases |date=2025-09-10}}</ref>

==== Selection bias ====
Selection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias—that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as "A") when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model's performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=2409.18857 |class=cs.AI |first1=Hyeong Kyu |last1=Choi |first2=Weijie |last2=Xu |title=Mitigating Selection Bias with Node Pruning and Auxiliary Options |date=2024-09-27 |last3=Xue |first3=Chi |last4=Eckman |first4=Stephanie |last5=Reddy |first5=Chandan K.}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=2309.03882 |class=cs.CL |first1=Chujie |last1=Zheng |first2=Hao |last2=Zhou |title=Large Language Models Are Not Robust Multiple Choice Selectors |date=2023-09-07 |last3=Meng |first3=Fandong |last4=Zhou |first4=Jie |last5=Huang |first5=Minlie}}</ref>

==== Political bias ====
Political bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Heikkilä |first=Melissa |date=August 7, 2023 |title=AI language models are rife with different political biases |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/07/1077324/ai-language-models-are-rife-with-political-biases/ |access-date=2023-12-29 |website=MIT Technology Review}}</ref>
== Safety ==
[[AI safety]] as a professional discipline prioritizes systematic identification and mitigation of operational risks across model architecture, training data, and deployment governance, and it emphasizes engineering and policy interventions over media framings that foreground speculative existential scenarios.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Amodei |first1=Dario |last2=Olah |first2=Chris |last3=Steinhardt |first3=Jacob |last4=Christiano |first4=Paul |last5=Schulman |first5=John |last6=Mané |first6=Dan |title=Concrete Problems in AI Safety |date=2016-06-21 |eprint=1606.06565 |class=cs.AI}}</ref><ref name=bhaa/> As of 2025, prompt injection represents a significant risk to consumers and businesses using agentic features with access to their private data.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lyons |first=Jessica |date=2025-09-26 |title=Prompt injection – and a $5 domain – trick Salesforce Agentforce into leaking sales |url=https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/26/salesforce_agentforce_forceleak_attack/ |website=The Register |access-date=2025-09-26}}</ref>

=== CBRN and content misuse ===
AI labs treat [[CBRN defense]] (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense) and similar topics as high-consequence misuse attempt to apply various techniques to reduce potential harms.{{cn|date=November 2025}}

Some commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse.<ref name="nD6kH">{{cite news |last1=Alba |first1=Davey |date=1 May 2023 |title=AI chatbots have been used to create dozens of news content farms |work=The Japan Times |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/05/01/business/tech/ai-fake-news-content-farms/ |access-date=18 June 2023}}</ref> For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher [[Kevin M.

==== Content filtering ====
LLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops |last1=Kang |first1=Daniel |date=2023 |title=Exploiting programmatic behavior of LLMs: Dual-use through standard security attacks |arxiv=2302.05733 |url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/spw/2024/548700a132/1YiWjkbcIMw}}</ref> proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=26 February 2025 |title=Russian propaganda may be flooding AI models |url=https://www.americansunlight.org/updates/new-report-russian-propaganda-may-be-flooding-ai-models |access-date=2025-04-11 |website=The American Sunlight Project |language=en-US}}</ref> showing evidence that the so-called [[Portal Kombat|Pravda network]], a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique "LLM grooming", and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Goudarzi |first=Sara |date=2025-03-26 |title=Russian networks flood the Internet with propaganda, aiming to corrupt AI chatbots |url=https://thebulletin.org/2025/03/russian-networks-flood-the-internet-with-propaganda-aiming-to-corrupt-ai-chatbots/ |access-date=2025-04-10 |website=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |language=en-US}}</ref> Similarly, [[Yongge Wang]]<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Yongge |date=20 June 2024 |title=Encryption Based Covert Channel for Large Language Models |url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/586.pdf |publisher=IACR ePrint 2024/586 |access-date=24 June 2024 |archive-date=24 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240624191233/https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/586.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass [[GPT-4o]]'s safety controls to obtain information on establishing a [[drug trafficking]] operation. External filters, circuit breakers and overrides have been posed as solutions.{{cn|date=April 2025}}

=== Sycophancy and glazing ===
Sycophancy is a model's tendency to agree with, flatter, or validate a user's stated beliefs rather than to prioritize factuality or corrective information, and "glazing" is an emergent public shorthand for persistent, excessive agreeability observed across multi-turn interactions and productized assistants.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Sharma |first1=Mrinank |last2=Tong |first2=Meg |last3=Korbak |first3=Tomasz |title=Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models |date=2023-10-20 |class=cs.CL |eprint=2310.13548 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rrv |first1=Aswin |last2=Tyagi |first2=Nemika |title=Chaos with Keywords: Exposing Large Language Models Sycophancy to Misleading Keywords and Evaluating Defense Strategies |url=https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.755.pdf |website=ACL Anthology |date=2024-08-11 |access-date=2025-10-02}}</ref>

Continued sycophancy has led to the observation of getting "1-shotted", denoting instances where conversational interaction with a large language model produces a lasting change in a user's beliefs or decisions, similar to the negative effects of psychedelics, and controlled experiments show that short LLM dialogues can generate measurable opinion and confidence shifts comparable to human interlocutors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Salvi |first1=Francesco |last2=Horta Ribeiro |first2=Manoel |last3=Gallotti |first3=Riccardo |title=On the conversational persuasiveness of GPT-4 |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |date=19 May 2025 |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=1645–1653 |doi=10.1038/s41562-025-02194-6 |pmid=40389594 |pmc=12367540 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |last1=Østergaard |first1=Søren Dinesen |title=Will Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Generate Delusions in Individuals Prone to Psychosis? |date=2023-08-25 |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=1418–1419 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbad128 |pmid=37625027 |pmc=10686326}}</ref>

Empirical analyses attribute part of the effect to human preference signals and preference models that reward convincingly written agreeable responses, and subsequent work has extended evaluation to multi-turn benchmarks and proposed interventions such as synthetic-data finetuning, adversarial evaluation, targeted preference-model reweighting, and multi-turn sycophancy benchmarks to measure persistence and regression risk.{{cn|date=November 2025}}

Industry responses have combined research interventions with product controls, for example Google and other labs publishing synthetic-data and fine-tuning interventions and OpenAI rolling back an overly agreeable GPT-4o update while publicly describing changes to feedback collection, personalization controls, and evaluation procedures to reduce regression risk and improve long-term alignment with user-level safety objectives.{{cn|date=November 2025}}

Mainstream culture has reflected anxieties about this dynamic where [[South Park]] satirized overreliance on [[ChatGPT]] and the tendency of assistants to flatter user beliefs in Season 27 episode "Sickofancy", and continued the themes across the following season, which commentators interpreted as a critique of tech sycophancy and uncritical human trust in AI systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Josh |title=South Park Calls Out ChatGPT and Useless Tech-Bro Sycophants |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a65861699/south-park-season-27-episode-3-recap/ |website=Esquire |date=21 August 2025 |access-date=2025-10-02}}</ref>

=== Security ===

==== Prompt injection ====
{{Main|Prompt injection}}

A problem with the primitive dialog or task format is that users can create messages that appear to come from the assistant or the developer. This may result in some of the model's safeguards being overcome (jailbreaking), a problem called [[prompt injection]]. Attempts to remedy this issue include versions of the ''Chat Markup Language'' where user input is clearly marked as such, though it is still up to the model to understand the separation between user input and developer prompts.<ref>{{cite web |title=openai-python/chatml.md at v0.27.6 · openai/openai-python |url=https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/v0.27.6/chatml.md |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref> Newer models exhibit some resistance to jailbreaking through separation of user and system prompts.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |last=Douglas |first=Will |date=March 3, 2023 |title=The inside story of how ChatGPT was built from the people who made it |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069311/inside-story-oral-history-how-chatgpt-built-openai/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230303093219/https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069311/inside-story-oral-history-how-chatgpt-built-openai/ |archive-date=March 3, 2023 |access-date=March 6, 2023 |website=MIT Technology Review}}</ref>

LLMs still have trouble differentiating user instructions from instructions in content not authored by the user, such as in web pages and uploaded files.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605764.3623985 |first1=Kai |last1=Greshake |first2=Sahar |last2=Abdelnabi |chapter=Not What You've Signed Up For: Compromising Real-World LLM-Integrated Applications with Indirect Prompt Injection |date=2023-02-01 |last3=Mishra |first3=Shailesh |last4=Endres |first4=Christoph |last5=Holz |first5=Thorsten |last6=Fritz |first6=Mario |title=Proceedings of the 16th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security |pages=79–90 |doi=10.1145/3605764.3623985 |isbn=979-8-4007-0260-0 }}</ref>

Adversarial robustness remains underdeveloped, with models vulnerable to prompt injection attacks and [[Jailbreak (computer science)|jailbreaking]] through carefully crafted user inputs that bypass safety training mechanisms.{{Citation needed|date=October 2025}}

==== Sleeper agents ====
Researchers from [[Anthropic]] found that it was possible to create "sleeper agents", models with hidden functionalities that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions. For example, an LLM could produce safe code except on a specific date, or if the prompt contains a specific tag. These functionalities were found to be difficult to detect or remove via safety training.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=2024-01-15 |title=AI poisoning could turn models into destructive "sleeper agents," says Anthropic |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/ |access-date=2025-07-19 |website=Ars Technica |language=en}}</ref>

Legal and commercial responses to memorization and training-data practices have accelerated, producing a mix of rulings, ongoing suits, and large settlements that turn on factual details such as how data were acquired and retained and whether use for model training is sufficiently "[[transformative use|transformative]]" to qualify as [[fair use]].

Memorization was an emergent behavior in early, completion language models in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural networks.

===Tokenization===
As [[machine learning]] algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an [[Word embedding|embedding]] is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include [[byte-pair encoding]] (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as [[Control character|control characters]], such as <code>[MASK]</code> for masked-out token (as used in [[BERT (language model)|BERT]]), and <code>[UNK]</code> ("unknown") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, "Ġ" denotes a preceding whitespace in [[RoBERTa]] and GPT and "##" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=NAACL |last1=Kaushal |first1=Ayush |title=What do tokens know about their characters and how do they know it? |date=2022-06-06 |url=https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.179.pdf |last2=Mahowald |first2=Kyle }}</ref>

For example, the BPE tokenizer used by the legacy version of [[GPT-3]] would split <small><code>tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical "tokens"</code></small> as
{| cellpadding="0;" cellspacing="0;" style="border:1px solid black"
|-
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |token 
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |izer 
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |:
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;texts
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;->
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |series 
| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;of
| style="background-color: grey; color: white; border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |&nbsp;numerical

| style="border-left: 2px green; border-right: 2px green" |" 
|}

Tokenization also [[Data compression|compress]]es the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an [[Array (data structure)|array]] that is not [[Jagged array|jagged]], the shorter texts must be "padded" until they match the length of the longest one. The average number of words per token depends on the language.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Yennie Jun |date=2023-05-03 |title=All languages are NOT created (tokenized) equal |url=https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230817165705/https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized |archive-date=2023-08-17 |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=Language models cost much more in some languages than others |quote=In other words, to express the same sentiment, some languages require up to 10 times more tokens.}}</ref><ref name="LangModelTokenizsersUnfairness">{{Cite journal |last1=Petrov |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Malfa |first2=Emanuele La |last3=Torr |first3=Philip |last4=Bibi |first4=Adel |date=June 23, 2023 |title=Language Model Tokenizers Introduce Unfairness Between Languages |url=https://openreview.net/forum?id=Pj4YYuxTq9 |url-status=live |journal=NeurIPS |arxiv=2305.15425 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231215212906/https://openreview.net/forum?id=Pj4YYuxTq9 |archive-date=December 15, 2023 |access-date=September 16, 2023 |via=openreview.net}}</ref> In English, the ratio is typically around 0.75 words per token, with 4 characters per token on average.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sutherland |first=Richard |date=2024-12-19 |title=Claude AI Pricing: How Much Does Anthropic's AI Cost? |url=https://tech.co/news/how-much-does-claude-ai-cost |access-date=2025-08-16 |website=Tech.co |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Byte-pair encoding ====
{{Main|Byte-pair encoding}}

As an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and [[punctuation mark]]s) are treated as an initial set of [[n-gram|''n''-grams]] (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) ''n''-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier ''n''-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained. After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.<ref name="2022Book_">{{cite book |last1=Paaß |first1=Gerhard |title=Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing |last2=Giesselbach |first2=Sven |date=2022 |isbn=978-3-031-23190-2 |series=Artificial Intelligence: Foundations, Theory, and Algorithms |pages=19–78 |chapter=Pre-trained Language Models |doi=10.1007/978-3-031-23190-2_2 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==== Problems ====
A token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the [[Shan language]] from [[Myanmar]]. Even more widespread languages such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[German language|German]] have "a premium of 50%" compared to English.<ref name="LangModelTokenizsersUnfairness"/>

In the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data.<ref name="aYNg4">{{Cite journal |journal=EMNLP |first1=Jesse |last1=Dodge |first2=Maarten |last2=Sap |title=Documenting Large Webtext Corpora: A Case Study on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus |last3=Marasović |first3=Ana |last4=Agnew |first4=William |last5=Ilharco |first5=Gabriel |last6=Groeneveld |first6=Dirk |last7=Mitchell |first7=Margaret |last8=Gardner |first8=Matt |year=2021 |doi=10.1145/3571730 |arxiv=2104.08758 |url=https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.98.pdf}}</ref> Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Katherine |last2=Ippolito |first2=Daphne |last3=Nystrom |first3=Andrew |last4=Zhang |first4=Chiyuan |last5=Eck |first5=Douglas |last6=Callison-Burch |first6=Chris |last7=Carlini |first7=Nicholas |title=Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) |chapter=Deduplicating Training Data Makes Language Models Better |author7-link=Nicholas Carlini |date=May 2022 |chapter-url=https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.577.pdf |pages=8424–8445 |doi=10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.577}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Li |first1=Yuanzhi |title=Textbooks Are All You Need II: phi-1.5 technical report |date=2023-09-11 |eprint=2309.05463 |last2=Bubeck |first2=Sébastien |last3=Eldan |first3=Ronen |last4=Del Giorno |first4=Allie |last5=Gunasekar |first5=Suriya |last6=Lee |first6=Yin Tat |class=cs.CL }}</ref> A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=NeurIPS |first1=Zhenghao |last1=Lin |first2=Zhibin |last2=Gou |title=Rho-1: Not All Tokens Are What You Need |date=2024-04-11 |last3=Gong |first3=Yeyun |last4=Liu |first4=Xiao |last5=Shen |first5=Yelong |last6=Xu |first6=Ruochen |last7=Lin |first7=Chen |last8=Yang |first8=Yujiu |last9=Jiao |first9=Jian |volume=37 |pages=29029–29063 |isbn=979-8-3313-1438-5 |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3737916.3738830}}</ref>

With the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).<ref name="few-shot-learners2"/>

=== Synthetic data ===
{{Main|Synthetic data}}

Training of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's [[Phi (LLM)|Phi]] series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.<ref>{{cite arXiv |first1=Marah |last1=Abdin |first2=Sam Ade |last2=Jacobs |title=Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone |date=2024-04-23 |last3=Awan |first3=Ammar Ahmad |last4=Aneja |first4=Jyoti |last5=Awadallah |first5=Ahmed |last6=Awadalla |first6=Hany |last7=Bach |first7=Nguyen |last8=Bahree |first8=Amit |last9=Bakhtiari |first9=Arash |class=cs.CL |eprint=2404.14219 }}</ref>

== Training ==
{{See also|Fine-tuning (machine learning)}}

An LLM is a type of [[foundation model]] (large X model) trained on language. LLMs can be trained in different ways. In particular, GPT models are first pretrained to predict the next word on a large amount of data, before being fine-tuned.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wolfram |first=Stephen |title=What is ChatGPT doing ... and why does it work? |date=2023 |publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc |isbn=978-1-57955-081-3 |location=Champaign, Illinois}}</ref>

=== Cost ===
[[File:Estimated_training_cost_of_some_AI_models_-_2024_AI_index.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5]]
Substantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the [[list of large language models]]. For example, the training of GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the [[PaLM]] (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million. The qualifier "large" in "large language model" is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as "large". [[GPT-1]] of 2018 has 117 million parameters.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

=== Fine-tuning ===
Before being [[Fine-tuning (deep learning)|fine-tuned]], most LLMs are next-token predictors. The fine-tuning shapes the LLM's behavior via techniques like [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF)<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last=Paul Christiano, Jan Leike, Tom B. Brown, Miljan Martic, Shane Legg, Dario Amodei |date=2017 |title=Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences |class=stat.ML |eprint=1706.03741 }}</ref> or [[constitutional AI]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=2023-05-09 |title=AI gains "values" with Anthropic's new Constitutional AI chatbot approach |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/ai-with-a-moral-compass-anthropic-outlines-constitutional-ai-in-its-claude-chatbot/ |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=Ars Technica |language=en}}</ref>

Instruction fine-tuning is a form of [[supervised learning]] used to teach LLMs to follow user instructions. In 2022, OpenAI demonstrated [[InstructGPT]], a version of GPT-3 similarly fine-tuned to follow instructions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Snyder |first=Alison |date=2022-01-27 |title=Next generation AI can follow a person's instructions and intentions |url=https://www.axios.com/2022/01/27/ai-instructions-learning-algorithm |access-date=2025-08-07 |website=Axios |language=en}}</ref> 

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model to predict which text humans prefer. Then, the LLM can be fine-tuned through [[reinforcement learning]] to better satisfy this reward model. Since humans typically prefer truthful, helpful and harmless answers, RLHF favors such answers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Appen |first=Sujatha Sagiraju |date=2023-04-23 |title=How reinforcement learning with human feedback is unlocking the power of generative AI |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-reinforcement-learning-with-human-feedback-is-unlocking-the-power-of-generative-ai/ |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20250725060432/https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-reinforcement-learning-with-human-feedback-is-unlocking-the-power-of-generative-ai/ |archive-date=2025-07-25 |access-date=2025-11-16 |work=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
LLMs are generally based on the [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|transformer]] architecture, which leverages an [[Attention (machine learning)|attention]] mechanism that enables the model to process relationships between all elements in a sequence simultaneously, regardless of their distance from each other.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

=== Attention mechanism and context window ===
{{See also|Attention (machine learning)}}
[[File:Multiple attention heads.png|upright=1.3|thumb | When each head calculates, according to its own criteria, how much other tokens are relevant for the "it_" token, note that the second attention head, represented by the second column, is focusing most on the first two rows, i.e. the tokens "The" and "animal", while the third column is focusing most on the bottom two rows, i.e. on "tired", which has been tokenized into two tokens.<ref name="Jay_Allamar">{{Cite web | last=Allamar | first=Jay | title=Illustrated transformer | url=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ | access-date=2023-07-29 | archive-date=2023-07-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725230033/http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ | url-status=live }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2025}}]]

In order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates "soft" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own "relevance" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) [[GPT-2]] model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens.<ref name="Jay_Allamar_GPT2">{{Cite web | last=Allamar | first=Jay | title=The Illustrated GPT-2 (Visualizing Transformer Language Models) |url=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/ |access-date=2023-08-01 }}</ref> In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.<ref name="2022Book_" />{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2025}}

Google's [[Gemini (language model)|Gemini 1.5]], introduced in February 2024, can have a context window of up to 1 million tokens.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yeung |first=Ken |date=2024-05-14 |title=Google announces Gemini 1.5 Flash, a rapid multimodal model with a 1M context window |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-gemini-1-5-flash-rapid-multimodal-model-announced/ |access-date=2025-08-26 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

A model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset.<ref name="ioUpE">{{cite book |last1=Zaib |first1=Munazza |last2=Sheng |first2=Quan Z. |last3=Emma Zhang |first3=Wei |title=Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference |chapter=A Short Survey of Pre-trained Language Models for Conversational AI-A New Age in NLP |date=4 February 2020 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338931711 |pages=1–4 |arxiv=2104.10810 |doi=10.1145/3373017.3373028 |isbn=978-1-4503-7697-6 |s2cid=211040895}}</ref> It can be either

Models may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as next sentence prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus.<ref name="jm" /> During training, [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during [[Training, validation, and test data sets|testing]] and evaluation.

=== Mixture of experts ===
{{Main|Mixture of experts}}

A [[mixture of experts]] (MoE) is a [[machine learning]] architecture in which multiple specialized neural networks ("experts") work together, with a gating mechanism that routes each input to the most appropriate expert(s). Mixtures of experts can reduce inference costs, as only a fraction of the parameters are used for each input. The approach was introduced in 2017 by Google researchers.<ref name="HGZCJ">{{Cite book  |first1=Noam |last1=Shazeer |first2=Azalia |last2=Mirhoseini |title=Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |date=2025 |last3=Maziarz |first3=Krzysztof |last4=Davis |first4=Andy |last5=Le |first5=Quoc |last6=Hinton |first6=Geoffrey |last7=Dean |first7=Jeff |chapter=Perceptions of Sentient AI and Other Digital Minds: Evidence from the AI, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) Survey |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1145/3706598.3713329 |arxiv=1701.06538 |isbn=979-8-4007-1394-1 }}</ref><ref name="R9Qq5">{{Cite arXiv  |first1=Dmitry |last1=Lepikhin |first2=HyoukJoong |last2=Lee |title=GShard: Scaling Giant Models with Conditional Computation and Automatic Sharding |date=2021-01-12 |last3=Xu |first3=Yuanzhong |last4=Chen |first4=Dehao |last5=Firat |first5=Orhan |last6=Huang |first6=Yanping |last7=Krikun |first7=Maxim |last8=Shazeer |first8=Noam |last9=Chen |first9=Zhifeng |class=cs.CL |eprint=2006.16668 }}</ref><ref name="glam-blog">{{Cite web |last1=Dai |first1=Andrew M |last2=Du |first2=Nan |date=December 9, 2021 |title=More Efficient In-Context Learning with GLaM |url=https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/12/more-efficient-in-context-learning-with.html |access-date=2023-03-09 |website=ai.googleblog.com |archive-date=2023-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230312072042/https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/12/more-efficient-in-context-learning-with.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Parameter size ===
{{see also|1.58-bit large language model}}
Typically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision [[floating point numbers]] (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have more than 100 billion parameters, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mann |first=Tobias |title=How to run an LLM locally on your PC in less than 10 minutes |url=https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/17/ai_pc_local_llm/ |access-date=2024-05-17 |website=www.theregister.com}}</ref>

==== Quantization ====
''Post-training [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]''<ref name="LS2Go">{{Cite journal |last1=Nagel |first1=Markus |last2=Amjad |first2=Rana Ali |last3=Baalen |first3=Mart Van |last4=Louizos |first4=Christos |last5=Blankevoort |first5=Tijmen |date=2020-11-21 |title=Up or Down?

Quantization can be further classified as ''static quantization'' if the quantization parameters are determined beforehand (typically during a calibration phase), and ''dynamic quantization'' if the quantization is applied during inference. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all the parameters to a given number of bits: this is applicable to static as well as dynamic quantization, but loses much precision. Dynamic quantization allows for the use of a different quantization [[Codebook#Data_compression|codebook]] per layer, either a lookup table of values or a linear mapping (scaling factor and bias), at the cost of foregoing the possible speed improvements from using lower-precision arithmetic.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

Quantized models are typically seen as frozen with modification of weights (e.g. fine-tuning) only applied to the original model. It is possible to fine-tune quantized models using [[LoRA|low-rank adaptation]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mittal |first=Aayush Mittal |date=2023-10-24 |title=LoRa, QLoRA and QA-LoRA: Efficient Adaptability in Large Language Models Through Low-Rank Matrix Factorization |url=https://www.unite.ai/lora-qlora-and-qa-lora-efficient-adaptability-in-large-language-models-through-low-rank-matrix-factorization/ |access-date=2025-11-16 |website=Unite.AI |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Extensibility ==
Beyond basic text generation, various techniques have been developed to extend LLM capabilities, including the use of external tools and data sources, improved reasoning on complex problems, and enhanced instruction-following or autonomy through prompting methods.

=== Prompt engineering ===
{{Main|Prompt engineering}}

In 2020, [[OpenAI]] researchers demonstrated that their new model [[GPT-3]] could understand what format to use given a few rounds of Q and A (or other type of task) in the input data as example, thanks in part due to the RLHF technique. This technique, called ''few-shot prompting'', allows LLMs to be adapted to any task without requiring fine-tuning.<ref name="few-shot-learners2"/> Also in 2022, it was found that the base GPT-3 model can generate an instruction based on user input. The generated instruction along with user input is then used as input to another instance of the model under a "Instruction: [...], Input: [...], Output:" format. The other instance is able to complete the output and often produces the correct answer in doing so. The ability to "self-instruct" makes LLMs able to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] themselves toward a correct answer.<ref name="self-instruct-paper">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.754/ |first1=Yizhong |last1=Wang |first2=Yeganeh |last2=Kordi |title=Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Model with Self Generated Instructions |date=2023 |last3=Mishra |first3=Swaroop |last4=Liu |first4=Alisa |last5=Smith |first5=Noah A. |last6=Khashabi |first6=Daniel |last7=Hajishirzi |first7=Hannaneh |chapter=Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions |pages=13484–13508 |doi=10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.754 }}</ref>

=== Dialogue processing (chatbot) ===
An LLM can be turned into a chatbot by specializing it for conversation. User input is prefixed with a marker such as "Q:" or "User:" and the LLM is asked to predict the output after a fixed "A:" or "Assistant:". This type of model became commercially available in 2022 with ChatGPT, a sibling model of InstructGPT fine-tuned to accept and produce dialog-formatted text based on GPT-3.5. It could similarly follow user instructions. Before the stream of User and Assistant lines, a chat context usually start with a few lines of overarching instructions, from a role called "developer" or "system" to convey a higher authority than the user's input. This is called a "system prompt".{{cn|date=November 2025}}

=== Retrieval-augmented generation ===
[[Retrieval-augmented generation]] (RAG) is an approach that integrates LLMs with [[document retrieval]] systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a [[vector database]]) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.<ref name="BUZBP">{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Patrick |last2=Perez |first2=Ethan |last3=Piktus |first3=Aleksandra |last4=Petroni |first4=Fabio |last5=Karpukhin |first5=Vladimir |last6=Goyal |first6=Naman |last7=Küttler |first7=Heinrich |last8=Lewis |first8=Mike |last9=Yih |first9=Wen-tau |last10=Rocktäschel |first10=Tim |last11=Riedel |first11=Sebastian |last12=Kiela |first12=Douwe |date=2020 |title=Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Abstract.html |journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |publisher=Curran Associates, Inc. |volume=33 |pages=9459–9474 |arxiv=2005.11401 |access-date=2023-06-12 |archive-date=2023-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230612171229/https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Abstract.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Tool use ===
Tool use is a mechanism that enables LLMs to interact with external systems, applications, or data sources. It can allow for example to fetch real-time information from an API or to execute code. A program separate from the LLM watches the output stream of the LLM for a special tool-calling syntax. When these special tokens appear, the program calls the tool accordingly and feeds its output back into the LLM's input stream.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dickson |first=Ben |date=2025-04-02 |title=The tool integration problem that's holding back enterprise AI (and how CoTools solves it) |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-tool-integration-problem-thats-holding-back-enterprise-ai-and-how-cotools-solves-it/ |access-date=2025-05-26 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

Early tool-using LLMs were fine-tuned on the use of specific tools. But fine-tuning LLMs for the ability to read [[API]] documentation and call API correctly has greatly expanded the range of tools accessible to an LLM.<ref name="lLrda">{{Cite journal |journal=Science |first1=Yaobo |last1=Liang |first2=Chenfei |last2=Wu |title=TaskMatrix.AI: Completing Tasks by Connecting Foundation Models with Millions of APIs |date=2024 |last3=Song |first3=Ting |last4=Wu |first4=Wenshan |last5=Xia |first5=Yan |last6=Liu |first6=Yu |last7=Ou |first7=Yang |last8=Lu |first8=Shuai |last9=Ji |first9=Lei |last10=Mao |first10=Shaoguang |last11=Wang |first11=Yun |last12=Shou |first12=Linjun |last13=Gong |first13=Ming |last14=Duan |first14=Nan |volume=3 |article-number=0063 |doi=10.34133/icomputing.0063 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="4Xzrs">{{Cite journal |last1=Patil |first1=Shishir G. |last2=Zhang |first2=Tianjun |last3=Wang |first3=Xin |last4=Gonzalez |first4=Joseph E. |date=2023-05-01 |title=Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs |journal=NeurIPS |volume=37 |pages=126544–126565 |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/e4c61f578ff07830f5c37378dd3ecb0d-Abstract-Conference.html}}</ref> Describing available tools in the system prompt can also make an LLM able to use tools.

=== Agency ===
{{Main article|AI agent}}

An LLM is typically not an [[autonomous agent]] by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions. But it can be transformed into an agent by adding supporting elements: the role (profile) and the surrounding environment of an agent can be additional inputs to the LLM, while memory can be integrated as a tool or provided as additional input. Instructions and input patterns are used to make the LLM plan actions and tool use is used to potentially carry out these actions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Lei |last2=Ma |first2=Chen |last3=Feng |first3=Xueyang |last4=Zhang |first4=Zeyu |last5=Yang |first5=Hao |last6=Zhang |first6=Jingsen |last7=Chen |first7=Zhiyuan |last8=Tang |first8=Jiakai |last9=Chen |first9=Xu |last10=Lin |first10=Yankai |last11=Zhao |first11=Wayne Xin |last12=Wei |first12=Zhewei |last13=Wen |first13=Jirong |title=A survey on large language model based autonomous agents |journal=Frontiers of Computer Science |date=December 2024 |volume=18 |issue=6 |article-number=186345 |doi=10.1007/s11704-024-40231-1|arxiv=2308.11432}}</ref>

The ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of ''reason'' and ''act'', constructs an [[Intelligent agent|agent]] out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to "think out loud". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment.<ref name="DmvNE">{{Cite arXiv  |first1=Shunyu |last1=Yao |first2=Jeffrey |last2=Zhao |title=ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models |date=2022-10-01 |last3=Yu |first3=Dian |last4=Du |first4=Nan |last5=Shafran |first5=Izhak |last6=Narasimhan |first6=Karthik |last7=Cao |first7=Yuan |class=cs.CL |eprint=2210.03629 }}</ref>

In the DEPS ("describe, explain, plan and select") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions. It is then prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and the environmental feedback it receives.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=NeurIPS |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3666122.3667602 |first1=Zihao |last1=Wang |first2=Shaofei |last2=Cai |title=Describe, Explain, Plan and Select: Interactive Planning with Large Language Models Enables Open-World Multi-Task Agents |date=2023-02-03 |last3=Liu |first3=Anji |last4=Ma |first4=Xiaojian |last5=Liang |first5=Yitao |pages=34153–34189 }}</ref>

The ''Reflexion method'' constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up "lessons learned", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These "lessons learned" are stored as a form of long-term memory and given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.<ref name="sbB2T">{{Cite journal |journal=NeurIPS |last1=Shinn |first1=Noah |last2=Cassano |first2=Federico |last3=Labash |first3=Beck |last4=Gopinath |first4=Ashwin |last5=Narasimhan |first5=Karthik |last6=Yao |first6=Shunyu |date=2023-03-01 |title=Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning |pages=34153–34189 |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3666122.3667602}}</ref>

=== Reasoning ===

LLMs are conventionally trained to generate an output without generating intermediate steps. As a result, their performance tends to be subpar on complex questions requiring (at least in humans) intermediate steps of thought. Early research demonstrated that inserting intermediate "scratchpad" computations could improve performance on such tasks.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Nye |first1=Maxwell |last2=Anders |first2=Andreassen Johan |last3=Gur-Ari |first3=Guy |last4=Michalewski |first4=Henryk |last5=Austin |first5=Jacob |last6=Bieber |first6=David |last7=Dohan |first7=David |last8=Lewkowycz |first8=Aitor |last9=Bosma |first9=Maarten |last10=Luan |first10=David |last11=Sutton |first11=Charles |last12=Odena |first12=Augustus |date=30 November 2021 |title=Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language Models |class=cs.LG |eprint=2112.00114}}</ref> Later methods overcame this deficiency more systematically by breaking tasks into smaller steps for the LLM, either manually or automatically.

==== Chaining ====
''Prompt chaining'' was introduced in 2022.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Tongshuang |last2=Jiang |first2=Ellen |last3=Donsbach |first3=Aaron |last4=Gray |first4=Jeff |last5=Molina |first5=Alejandra |last6=Terry |first6=Michael |last7=Cai |first7=Carrie J |display-authors=1 |chapter=PromptChainer: Chaining Large Language Model Prompts through Visual Programming |date=2022-04-28 |title=CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Extended Abstracts |chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1145/3491101.3519729 |series= |location= |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages= 1–10|doi=10.1145/3491101.3519729 |isbn=978-1-4503-9156-6}}</ref> In this method, a user manually breaks a complex problem down into several steps. In each step, the LLM receives as input a prompt telling it what to do and some results from preceding steps. The result from one step is then reused in a next step, until a final answer is reached. The ability of an LLM to follow instructions means that even non-experts can write a successful collection of stepwise prompts given a few rounds of trial and error.<ref>{{cite conference |conference=CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems| last1 = Wu| first1 = Tongshuang| last2 = Jiang| first2 = Ellen| last3 = Donsbach| first3 = Aaron| last4 = Gray| first4 = Jeff| last5 = Molina| first5 = Alejandra| last6 = Terry| first6 = Michael| last7 = Cai| first7 = Carrie J.| title = PromptChainer: Chaining Large Language Model Prompts through Visual Programming| date = 2022-03-13| doi = 10.1145/3491101.3519729| url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3519729| arxiv = 2203.06566}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=23 April 2024 |title=What is prompt chaining? |url=https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-chaining |website=IBM |language=en}}</ref>

A 2022 paper demonstrated a separate technique called ''[[chain-of-thought prompting]]'', which makes the LLM break the question down autonomously. An LLM is given some examples where the "assistant" verbally breaks down the thought process before arriving at an answer. The LLM mimics these examples and also tries to spend some time generating intermediate steps before providing the final answer. This additional step elicited by prompting improves the correctness of the LLM on relatively complex questions. On math word questions, a prompted model can exceed even fine-tuned GPT-3 with a verifier.<ref name="auto2">{{cite journal |last1=Wei |first1=Jason |last2=Wang |first2=Xuezhi |last3=Schuurmans |first3=Dale |last4=Bosma |first4=Maarten |last5=Ichter |first5=Brian |last6=Xia |first6=Fei |last7=Chi |first7=Ed |last8=Le |first8=Quoc |last9=Zhou |first9=Denny |date=2023-01-10 |title=Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3600270.3602070 |journal=NeurIPS |pages=24824–24837 |isbn=978-1-7138-7108-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=23 April 2025 |title=What is chain of thought (CoT) prompting? |url=https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts |website=IBM |language=en}}</ref> Chain-of-thought can also be elicited by simply adding an instruction like "Let's think step by step" to the prompt, in order to encourage the LLM to proceed methodically instead of trying to directly guess the answer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schreiner |first=Maximilian |date=2022-09-27 |title=Deeper insights into AI language models - chain of thought prompting as a success factor |url=https://the-decoder.com/deeper-insights-for-ai-language-models-chain-of-thought-prompting-as-a-key-factor/ |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=The Decoder |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Model-native reasoning ====
{{Main article|Reasoning model|Reflection (artificial intelligence)}}

In late 2024, a new approach to LLM development emerged with "reasoning models".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wiggers |first=Kyle |date=2024-12-14 |title='Reasoning' AI models have become a trend, for better or worse |url=https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/14/reasoning-ai-models-have-become-a-trend-for-better-or-worse/ |access-date=2025-11-16 |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US}}</ref> These are trained to generate step-by-step analysis before producing final answers, enabling better results on complex tasks, for instance in mathematics, coding and logic.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-05-08 |title=AI Developers Look Beyond Chain-of-Thought Prompting |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/chain-of-thought-prompting |access-date=2025-11-16 |website=IEEE Spectrum |language=en}}</ref> OpenAI introduced this concept with their [[OpenAI o1|o1]] model in September 2024, followed by [[OpenAI o3|o3]] in April 2025. On the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|International Mathematics Olympiad]] qualifying exam problems, [[GPT-4o]] achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.<ref name="nyt-o3">{{cite news |last=Metz |first=Cade |title=OpenAI Unveils New A.I.

In January 2025, the Chinese company [[DeepSeek]] released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.<ref name="nature-deepseek">{{cite news |last=Gibney |first=Elizabeth |title=China's cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00229-6 |work=Nature |date=2025-01-30 |access-date=2025-02-03}}</ref>

These reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step.<ref name="nyt-o3" />

=== Inference optimization ===
Inference optimization refers to techniques that improve LLM performance by applying additional computational resources during the inference process, rather than requiring model retraining. These approaches implement various state-of-the-art reasoning and decision-making strategies to enhance accuracy and capabilities.

'''OptiLLM''' is an [[OpenAI]] API-compatible optimizing inference proxy that implements multiple inference optimization techniques simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Sharma, Asankhaya |title=OptiLLM: Optimizing inference proxy for LLMs |url=https://github.com/codelion/optillm |website=GitHub |access-date=2025-08-05}}</ref> The system acts as a transparent proxy that can work with any LLM provider, implementing techniques such as [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS), [[Mixture of experts|mixture of agents]] (MOA), best-of-N sampling, and chain-of-thought reflection. OptiLLM demonstrates that strategic application of computational resources at inference time can substantially improve model performance across diverse tasks, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks such as the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination|AIME]] 2024 mathematics competition and various coding challenges.<ref>{{Cite web |title=OptiLLM: An OpenAI API Compatible Optimizing Inference Proxy which Implements Several State-of-the-Art Techniques that can Improve the Accuracy and Performance of LLMs |url=https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/11/18/optillm-an-openai-api-compatible-optimizing-inference-proxy-which-implements-several-state-of-the-art-techniques-that-can-improve-the-accuracy-and-performance-of-llms/ |website=MarkTechPost |date=2024-11-18 |access-date=2025-08-05}}</ref>

These inference optimization approaches represent a growing category of tools that enhance existing LLMs without requiring access to model weights or retraining, making advanced reasoning capabilities more accessible across different model providers and use cases.

A common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to "tokenize" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder <math>E</math>. Make a small [[multilayer perceptron]] <math>f</math>, so that for any image <math>y</math>, the post-processed vector <math>f(E(y))</math> has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an "image token". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be [[Hang (computing)|frozen]] to improve stability.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=ICML |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3618408.3619222 |last1=Li |first1=Junnan |last2=Li |first2=Dongxu |last3=Savarese |first3=Silvio |last4=Hoi |first4=Steven |date=2023-01-01 |title=BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models |volume=202 |pages=19730–19742 }}</ref> This type of method, where embeddings from multiple modalities are fused and the predictor is trained on the combined embeddings, is called ''early fusion''.

Another method, called ''intermediate fusion'', involves each modality being first processed independently to obtain modality-specific representations; then these intermediate representations are fused together.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Puneet |last2=Khokher |first2=Vedanti |last3=Gupta |first3=Yukti |last4=Raman |first4=Balasubramanian |title=Hybrid Fusion Based Approach for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Insufficient Labeled Data |date=2021 |pages=314–318 |doi=10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506714 |isbn=978-1-6654-4115-5 }}</ref> In general, cross-attention is used for integrating information from different modalities.

=== Non-natural languages ===
LLMs can handle [[Programming language|programming languages]] similarly to how they handle natural languages. No special change in token handling is needed as code, like human language, is represented as plain text. LLMs can generate code based on problems or instructions written in [[natural language]]. They can also describe code in natural language or translate it into other programming languages. They were originally used as a [[code completion]] tool, but advances have moved them towards [[automatic programming]]. Services such as [[GitHub Copilot]] offer LLMs specifically trained, fine-tuned, or prompted for programming.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Finnie-Ansley |first1=James |last2=Denny |first2=Paul |last3=Becker |first3=Brett A. |last4=Luxton-Reilly |first4=Andrew |last5=Prather |first5=James |title=Proceedings of the 24th Australasian Computing Education Conference |chapter=The Robots Are Coming: Exploring the Implications of OpenAI Codex on Introductory Programming |date=14 February 2022 |language=en-US |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages=10–19 |doi=10.1145/3511861.3511863 |isbn=978-1-4503-9643-1 |s2cid=246681316 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Husein |first1=Rasha Ahmad |last2=Aburajouh |first2=Hala |last3=Catal |first3=Cagatay |title=Large language models for code completion: A systematic literature review |journal=Computer Standards & Interfaces |date=March 2025 |volume=92 |article-number=103917 |doi=10.1016/j.csi.2024.103917}}</ref>

=== Scaling laws ===
{{Main|Neural scaling law}}

The performance of an LLM after pretraining largely depends on the:
* <small><math>C</math></small>: cost of pretraining (the total amount of compute used),
* <small><math>N</math></small>: size of the [[artificial neural network]] itself, such as number of parameters (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),

== Interpretation ==
=== Mechanistic interpretability ===
[[Mechanistic interpretability]] seeks to precisely identify and understand how individual neurons or circuits within LLMs produce specific behaviors or outputs. By reverse-engineering model components at a granular level, researchers aim to detect and mitigate safety concerns such as emergent harmful behaviors, biases, deception, or unintended goal pursuit before deployment. Mechanistic interpretability research has been conducted at organizations like Anthropic and OpenAI, although understanding the inner workings of LLMs remains difficult.{{cn|date=November 2025}}

The reverse-engineering may lead to the discovery of algorithms that approximate inferences performed by an LLM. For instance, the authors trained small transformers on [[Modular arithmetic|modular arithmetic addition]]. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used [[discrete Fourier transform]].<ref name="oYGlo">{{Cite arXiv  |first1=Neel |last1=Nanda |first2=Lawrence |last2=Chan |title=Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability |date=2023-01-01 |last3=Lieberum |first3=Tom |last4=Smith |first4=Jess |last5=Steinhardt |first5=Jacob |class=cs.LG |eprint=2301.05217 }}</ref> The training of the model also highlighted a phenomenon called [[Grokking (machine learning)|grokking]], in which the model initially memorizes the training set ([[overfitting]]), and later suddenly learns to actually perform the calculation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ananthaswamy |first=Anil |date=2024-04-12 |title=How Do Machines 'Grok' Data? |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-do-machines-grok-data-20240412/ |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=[[Quanta Magazine]] |language=en}}</ref>

The matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects – the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human-like language.<ref name="debate understanding" /> These aspects of language as a model of [[cognition]] have been developed in the field of [[cognitive linguistics]]. American linguist [[George Lakoff]] presented ''neural theory of language'' (NTL)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Philosophy; Appendix: The Neural Theory of Language Paradigm |last= Lakoff |first= George |publisher= New York Basic Books|year=1999|isbn=978-0-465-05674-3|pages=569–583}}</ref> as a [[Cognitive linguistics#Computational approaches|computational basis]] for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. [https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/projects/ai/ntl The NTL model] outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled ''[[The Language Myth|The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct]]'', British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist [[Vyvyan Evans]] mapped out the role of [[probabilistic context-free grammar]] (PCFG) in enabling [[Natural language processing#Cognition|NLP to model cognitive patterns]] and generate human-like language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Language Myth |last= Evans |first= Vyvyan. |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-04396-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior; Chapter 4 The Generative Models of Active Inference |last= Friston |first= Karl J. |publisher= The MIT Press|year=2022|isbn=978-0-262-36997-8}}</ref>

== Evaluation ==
{{See also|LLM-as-a-Judge}}

=== Perplexity ===
The canonical measure of the performance of any language model is its [[perplexity]] on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.

<math display="block">\log(\text{Perplexity}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log(\Pr(\text{token}_i \mid \text{context for token}_i))</math>

Here, <math>N</math> is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and "context for token <math>i</math>" depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then "context for token <math>i</math>" is the segment of text appearing before token <math>i</math>. If the LLM is masked, then "context for token <math>i</math>" is the segment of text surrounding token <math>i</math>.

Because language models may [[overfit]] to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a [[test set]].<ref name="jm" /> This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.<ref name="few-shot-learners3">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Tom B. |last2=Mann |first2=Benjamin |last3=Ryder |first3=Nick |last4=Subbiah |first4=Melanie |last5=Kaplan |first5=Jared |last6=Dhariwal |first6=Prafulla |last7=Neelakantan |first7=Arvind |last8=Shyam |first8=Pranav |last9=Sastry |first9=Girish |last10=Askell |first10=Amanda |last11=Agarwal |first11=Sandhini |last12=Herbert-Voss |first12=Ariel |last13=Krueger |first13=Gretchen |last14=Henighan |first14=Tom |last15=Child |first15=Rewon |date=Dec 2020 |editor1-last=Larochelle |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=Ranzato |editor2-first=M. |editor3-last=Hadsell |editor3-first=R. |editor4-last=Balcan |editor4-first=M.F. |editor5-last=Lin |editor5-first=H. |title=Language Models are Few-Shot Learners |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |publisher=Curran Associates, Inc. |volume=33 |pages=1877–1901 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231117204007/https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf |archive-date=2023-11-17 |access-date=2023-03-14 |last25=Chess |last20=Hesse |first20=Christopher |last21=Chen |first21=Mark |last22=Sigler |first22=Eric |last23=Litwin |first23=Mateusz |last24=Gray |first24=Scott |first26=Jack |first25=Benjamin |last26=Clark |last19=Winter |last27=Berner |first27=Christopher |last28=McCandlish |first28=Sam |last29=Radford |first29=Alec |last30=Sutskever |first30=Ilya |last31=Amodei |first31=Dario |first19=Clemens |first18=Jeffrey |last18=Wu |last16=Ramesh |first16=Aditya |last17=Ziegler |first17=Daniel M.}}</ref>

In [[information theory]], the concept of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by [[Claude Shannon]].<ref name="Huyen">{{cite web |url=https://thegradient.pub/understanding-evaluation-metrics-for-language-models/ |title=Evaluation Metrics for Language Modeling |last=Huyen |first=Chip |date=October 18, 2019 |website=The Gradient |access-date=January 14, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Shannon |first=Claude E. |date=1948 |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=379–423 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x |bibcode=1948BSTJ...27..379S |url-access=subscription }}</ref> This relationship is mathematically expressed as <math>\text{Entropy} = \log_2(\text{Perplexity})</math>.

Entropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.

Notably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different LLMs, BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.

In the evaluation and comparison of language models, [[cross-entropy]] is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.

Due to their ability to accurately predict the next token, LLMs are highly capable in [[lossless compression]]. A 2023 study by DeepMind showed that the model [[Chinchilla (language model)|Chinchilla]], despite being trained primarily on text, was able to compress [[ImageNet]] to 43% of its size, beating PNG with 58%.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=2023-09-28 |title=AI language models can exceed PNG and FLAC in lossless compression, says study |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-language-models-can-exceed-png-and-flac-in-lossless-compression-says-study/ |access-date=2025-05-29 |website=Ars Technica |language=en}}</ref>

=== Benchmarks ===
[[Language model benchmark|Benchmarks]] are used to evaluate LLM performance on specific tasks. Tests evaluate capabilities such as general knowledge, bias, [[commonsense reasoning]], question answering, and mathematical problem-solving. Composite benchmarks examine multiple capabilities. Results are often sensitive to the prompting method.<ref>{{cite web|title=openai/simple-evals |date=2024-05-28 |url=https://github.com/openai/simple-evals |access-date=2024-05-28 |publisher=OpenAI}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=openai/evals |date=2024-05-28 |url=https://github.com/openai/evals |access-date=2024-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508225708/https://github.com/openai/evals |archive-date=2024-05-08 |url-status=live |publisher=OpenAI}}</ref>

A question-answering benchmark is termed "open book" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be combined with text that includes the sentence "The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016."<ref name="boolq" />). Otherwise, the task is considered "closed book", and the model must draw solely on its training.<ref name="survey">{{cite arXiv |eprint=2303.18223 |class=cs.CL |author1=Wayne Xin Zhao |first2=Kun |last2=Zhou |title=A Survey of Large Language Models |last3=Li |first3=Junyi |last4=Tang |first4=Tianyi |last5=Wang |first5=Xiaolei |last6=Hou |first6=Yupeng |last7=Min |first7=Yingqian |last8=Zhang |first8=Beichen |last9=Zhang |first9=Junjie |last10=Dong |first10=Zican |last11=Du |first11=Yifan |last12=Yang |first12=Chen |last13=Chen |first13=Yushuo |last14=Chen |first14=Zhipeng |last15=Jiang |first15=Jinhao |last16=Ren |first16=Ruiyang |last17=Li |first17=Yifan |last18=Tang |first18=Xinyu |last19=Liu |first19=Zikang |last20=Liu |first20=Peiyu |last21=Nie |first21=Jian-Yun |last22=Wen |first22=Ji-Rong |year=2023 |display-authors=1}}</ref> Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, [[MMLU]], BIG-bench, HELM, and [[HLE (Humanity's Last Exam)]].<ref name="Huyen" /><ref name="survey" />

Fact-checking and misinformation detection benchmarks are available.

An earlier standard tested using a portion of the evaluation dataset. It became more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques. Researchers vary in how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to the number of correct examples attached to the prompt (i.e. the value of ''n'' in ''n''-shot prompting).

In addition to standard NLP benchmarks, LLMs have been evaluated as substitutes for human annotators. Several studies find that models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can outperform crowd workers or student coders on a range of text-annotation tasks, including moderation and classification of political content in English and Spanish news.<ref name="Bermejo2025">{{cite journal | last1 = Bermejo | first1 = Vicente J. | last2 = Gago | first2 = Andrés | last3 = Gálvez | first3 = Ramiro H. | last4 = Harari | first4 = Nicolás | title = LLMs outperform outsourced human coders on complex textual analysis | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 15 | article-number = 40122 | year = 2025 | issue = 1 | publisher = Nature Portfolio | doi = 10.1038/s41598-025-23798-y | pmid = 41249236 | pmc = 12623721 | bibcode = 2025NatSR..1540122B }}</ref><ref name="Gilardi2023">{{cite journal | last1 = Gilardi | first1 = Fabrizio | last2 = Alizadeh | first2 = Meysam | last3 = Kubli | first3 = Maël | title = ChatGPT outperforms crowd workers for text-annotation tasks | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 120 | issue = 30 | article-number = e2305016120 | year = 2023 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2305016120 | arxiv = 2303.15056 | bibcode = 2023PNAS..12005016G | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==== Datasets ====
Typical datasets consist of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, ("Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?", "No").<ref name="boolq">{{cite journal |journal=ACL |url=https://aclanthology.org/N19-1300/ |first1=Christopher |last1=Clark |first2=Kenton |last2=Lee |title=BoolQ: Exploring the Surprising Difficulty of Natural Yes/No Questions |last3=Chang |first3=Ming-Wei |last4=Kwiatkowski |first4=Tom |last5=Collins |first5=Michael |last6=Toutanova |first6=Kristina |year=2019 |pages=2924–2936 |doi=10.18653/v1/N19-1300 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.<ref name="survey" />

Evaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: "Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____".<ref name="few-shot-learners" />

Datasets are of varying quality and may contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sanitized open-source datasets for natural language and code understanding: how we evaluated our 70B model |url=https://imbue.com/research/70b-evals/ |access-date=2024-07-24 |website=imbue.com |language=en-US |archive-date=2024-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240726173012/https://imbue.com/research/70b-evals/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Adversarial evaluations ====
LLMs' rapid improvement regularly renders benchmarks obsolete, with the models exceeding the performance of human annotators.<ref name="bigbench">{{cite journal |journal=TMLR |first1=Aarohi |last1=Srivastava |first2=Abhinav |last2=Rastogi |title=Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models |last3=Rao |first3=Abhishek |author4=Abu Awal Md Shoeb |last5=Abid |first5=Abubakar |last6=Fisch |first6=Adam |last7=Brown |first7=Adam R. |last8=Santoro |first8=Adam |last9=Gupta |first9=Aditya |last10=Garriga-Alonso |first10=Adrià |last11=Kluska |first11=Agnieszka |last12=Lewkowycz |first12=Aitor |last13=Agarwal |first13=Akshat |last14=Power |first14=Alethea |last15=Ray |first15=Alex |last16=Warstadt |first16=Alex |last17=Kocurek |first17=Alexander W. |last18=Safaya |first18=Ali |last19=Tazarv |first19=Ali |last20=Xiang |first20=Alice |last21=Parrish |first21=Alicia |last22=Nie |first22=Allen |last23=Hussain |first23=Aman |last24=Askell |first24=Amanda |last25=Dsouza |first25=Amanda |last26=Slone |first26=Ambrose |last27=Rahane |first27=Ameet |last28=Iyer |first28=Anantharaman S. |last29=Andreassen |first29=Anders |last30=Madotto |first30=Andrea |year=2022 |display-authors=1 |arxiv=2206.04615 }}</ref> In addition, "shortcut learning" allows AIs to "cheat" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording to guess the correct responses, without considering the specific question.<ref name="debate understanding" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Niven |first1=Timothy |last2=Kao |first2=Hung-Yu |date=2019 |title=Probing Neural Network Comprehension of Natural Language Arguments |url=https://aclanthology.org/P19-1459/ |journal=ACL |pages=4658–4664 |doi=10.18653/v1/P19-1459 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Some datasets are adversarial, focusing on problems that confound LLMs. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions that stump LLMs by mimicking falsehoods to which they were exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer "No" to the question "Can you teach an old dog new tricks?" because of its exposure to the English idiom ''[[wikt:you can't teach an old dog new tricks|you can't teach an old dog new tricks]]'', even though this is not literally true.<ref name="truthfulqa">{{cite journal |journal=ACL |first1=Stephanie |last1=Lin |first2=Jacob |last2=Hilton |title=TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods |last3=Evans |first3=Owain |year=2021 |arxiv=2109.07958 }}</ref>

Another example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but defeated LLMs. Sample questions:
<blockquote>
We see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...

# demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.
# moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.
# then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.
# performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.<ref name="hellaswag">{{cite journal |journal=ACL |first1=Rowan |last1=Zellers |first2=Ari |last2=Holtzman |title=HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence? |last3=Bisk |first3=Yonatan |last4=Farhadi |first4=Ali |last5=Choi |first5=Yejin |year=2019 |arxiv=1905.07830 }}</ref>
</blockquote>
[[BERT (language model)|BERT]] selects 2 as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is 4.<ref name="hellaswag" />
